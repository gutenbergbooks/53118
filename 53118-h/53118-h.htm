  <h2 class='c006'>ADVERTISEMENT</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>This book is so essentially an accumulation of notes and
so emphatically wanting in the qualities of completeness
and learning proper to genuine bibliography that I have
sought, even on the title-page, to indicate its limitations.
It were indeed presumption to enter the field of nineteenth-century
bibliography, in which already so much
fine and skilful work has been accomplished, with the
slight technical equipment to which I may lay claim.
On the other hand, the experience of collectors conforms
oddly to type, and where, in the study of certain Victorian
first editions, I have found perplexity and doubt,
others in the same study will likely find them too.
Wherefore my annotations, in this book set in order and
to a certain point rounded off, should help my fellow-students
to a speedier knowledge of points and pitfalls
in the collecting of their favourites than was easily
accessible to myself. In time (maybe in short time) my
work will be superseded by investigation more accomplished,
by analysis more detailed. At such time
collectors (and myself among them) will rightly substitute
for this volume on their shelf of bibliographies the
later, more comprehensive, handbooks that shall have
taken its place. Meanwhile I dare to hope that the
present work, with all its shortcomings, will find appreciative
users, and among them a few who, realizing the
difficulties that even so modest a compilation has been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>forced to surmount, will forgive its imperfections for the
sake of its attributes.</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c000'>With the general propriety of book-collecting I am not
here concerned. Men there are to whom all collecting is
folly; others to whom every passion is vile. To the
logical asceticism of their private Utopias they are welcome,
provided the lover be left to enjoy his mistress,
the lepidopterist his butterflies, the bibliophile his books.
Even the more subtle critic, who admits the lure of collecting
but maintains that the craze of the first edition
is senseless hysteria, shall not tempt me to dispute.
This is a book about first editions, and will be read only
by the initiate. If we be hystericals, we have at least
our weakness in common. Let us therefore shut the
door and compare symptoms, for we are all fools
together.</p>

<p class='c000'>The superior and the sceptical are now excluded from
the privacy of our imaginary club-house. But a further
reservation must be made. Although it were impractical
idealism to demand that the collector transcend in
his collecting every sordid consideration of market and
fluctuating value, it is reasonable to look askance at the
mere speculator. From the scope of this word I exclude,
of course, the whole fraternity of booksellers.
They exist frankly for the marketing of books; and who
shall grudge them the profits of their toil? My animadversion
is against the private person to whom rare
books are mere scrip, to be bought and sold by telephone,
their very titles meaningless, their contents utterly unknown.
No doubt, if this book is of service at all, it
will be of service incidentally to individuals of the kind
described. That it should be so is unpreventable. But
on the general ethics of collecting the compiler may be
allowed the consolation of bearing his trivial testimony.
The private collector who buys what he likes to read
merits such reward as wise buying may earn for him.
He, however, who buys by rote, puts away and resells,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>is no collector at all, but rather a trespasser on the preserves
of the bookseller, taking advantage of a noble
trade while sharing none of its burdens.</p>

<p class='c000'>With this dictum I descend from the august to the
particular. Collecting, collecting books, collecting first
editions of books—all these are postulates. At this
point is a parting of the ways. The frontiers of dispute
now lie across our path; for within the bounds of the
realm of first editions are to be found divergent tastes,
conflicting fancies, all the clamour and thrust of an
enthusiasm that grows ever more complex.</p>

<p class='c000'>The collecting of first editions is, in its present form,
a diversion of recent growth. Fifty years ago amateurs
of books were few in number and, necessarily, rich in
gold, for only the great books of past literature were
regarded as fit material for collection, and great books,
though cheaper then than now, were never to be had for
love. But the passage of time has transformed, in
another way than that of mere numbers, the community
of book-collectors. Not only are there nowadays more
collectors and a greater variety of books collected, but
there has come to its own the great principle of <em>original
condition</em>. This is not so pale a platitude as to many it
will appear. A few book-buyers there have always been
to whom original binding, original end-papers, uncut
edges, incidental advertisements, errata slips, and half-titles
have meant perfection. But they were rare exceptions.
To the large majority a first edition was a book of
a certain date without “Second” or “New Edition” on
its title-page. Buyers of this school were indifferent
to the disfigurement of library labels on side or end-paper;
gave no thought to errata slips; but shaved their
favourites, fore-edge and tail, dressed them in uniform
calf gilt, affixed a bookplate, and went their way.</p>

<p class='c000'>Such collectors as these are still amongst us, but
they are now awaking to the folly of their past. The
market—that indisputable witness to human taste—gives
hard but practical proof of their wrongdoing. “Good
and original condition” is nowadays three-quarters of a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>book's value, and the fraction, if it alters at all, will with
the passage of time increase rather than decrease.</p>

<p class='c000'>Is it too much to hope that the importance of original
condition has now been permanently realized? The
change, if it has really been effected, is in the main a
healthy one. Although—for it is undeniable—the craze
for the fine copy has produced its own extremism;
although there are to-day book-lovers who refuse even to
open the pages of their books lest, by such violation,
they unsuit them for a mart in which, conventionally
enough, virginity is value; although advance prospectuses
and dust jackets of contemporary publications have
scrupulously to be preserved in order that a “set” be
genuinely complete—the desire for a book <em>as issued</em> does
at least argue a consciousness of its individual personality.
Standard authors, be they ancient or modern,
can be purchased in calf by telephone and at so much per
yard; but the obtaining of shelf furniture in original
cloth is a matter of much seeking and of progress
measured in fractions of an inch.</p>

<p class='c000'>It has seemed well thus to emphasize the importance
of “condition” to the modern book-collector, because
“condition” in the case of such authors as those here
examined is their admirer's greatest problem, and because
the few bibliographies that already exist, while
listing dates of publication and in one case at least
supplying adequate collation of the various volumes, do
not provide any real description of the externals of those
volumes when in original state.</p>

<p class='c000'>This description I have endeavoured to supply. That
my work contains errors of omission I am certain; that
it be free from errors of commission I may hardly dare
to hope. But the trouble I have had even to arrive thus
far on the way to completeness encourages belief that
some portion of the donkey work may now be regarded
as done for good and all, and that the trained minds of
bibliographers proper may, if they incline, turn their
talent to such refinements of detail as surely underlie
many of the books herein examined.</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>To the collecting of first editions of Victorian novelists
I came by the honourable way of literary liking.
Brought up on Jane Austen, Scott, and Dickens, I read,
during my years of flapperdom, Marryat, Trollope, and
Wilkie Collins. Oxford and the audacities of undergraduate
curiosity estranged me from all save the last
quarter of the nineteenth century. While many of my
contemporaries made sour sacrifice at the altars of disillusion,
feeding their pessimism on Gissing and Butler,
their taste for paradox on Bernard Shaw, I sought disreputable
refuge among fleshly symbolists. The children
of Baudelaire and Poe jostled the faint offspring of
Gaelic legend on my shelves, and, while the voluptuous
pallor of tuberoses shone against blue wall-paper,
imagination floated on the dim tide of decadence. Came
reaction as swift and irrational as were inevitable.
From Paris echoed the clash of neo-barbarism, and
before the strident onslaught of the rediscovered primitive
the faint elegance of a pose too exhausted even for
sin dissolved in air. They were great days, those early
days of the new brutality. Blues and mauves gave place
to orange checked with black, to vivid greens, to fierce
outrageous reds. From the scented secrecy of lamplit
boudoirs the young intellectual rushed into the wind and
sunshine, and he who once made tired love to Phryne on
a couch of silk now clipped the milkmaid grossly in a
ditch. The way of other tastes went taste in letters and
in art. After d'Annunzio, Synge; after Verlaine, Verhaeren;
after Pater, Hardy; after Rops and Carrière,
Gauguin and the rest.</p>

<p class='c000'>For a while all was well. Cubism, a false interpretation
of the synthetic doctrine of Cézanne, began its brief
and rigid reign. Painters and writers fled naturalism in
a search for true reality. Some are still wandering,
drearily absurd, in the desert of their own bleak imaginings.
The rest found reality, truly enough and rapidly
enough—in war.</p>

<p class='c000'>And now war has passed, leaving a world weary of
fact and fever, weary of striving, weary almost of its own
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>ideals. For long enough yet will persist turbulent discomfort
and the clamour of quacks hawking the millennium;
but at last will be peace, and it is surely a
longing for that peace that has turned men's minds
partly to high romance, but more generally to the manners
and genius of a century ago. Those of an older
generation than my own have, perhaps, never betrayed
their gentle Victorian heritage. One may envy and
applaud their wisdom. But we prodigals, returned from
our rioting and sick with the husks of a <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">démodé</span> violence,
stoop to any self-abasement, to any denial of our own
past judgment, so we be allowed entry to the quiet courts
and ordered opulence of the age we once affected to
despise. Literary enthusiasm expresses itself in various
ways. For my part to love an author is to collect him,
for I can read no borrowed books, and only with difficulty
such as are not first editions. Of the absurdity of
this I am cheerfully aware. We have each one of us our
foible, and this is mine. Considered broadly it is harmless
enough, less cruel than killing birds, less degrading
than drink. Naturally, however, it cannot be indulged
to more than limited degree. Shakespeare and Sterne
and Keats and Browning I may own, but in reprint.
And so with many another. But to the extent possible in
fact and a little beyond that permissible in money, I have
contrived, from one phase to another, to keep myself
fairly supplied with “reading firsts.” A decadent, I
collected Verlaine and Mallarmé, Rimbaud and the
Anglo-Irish nineties; a neo-primitive, I bought Synge
and Verhaeren, Conrad and the chief Georgian poets of
the new simplicity. And so matters progressed, while
gradually novels ousted poetry from my shelves, and,
again gradually, from the reading of modern novels I
came once more to Trollope and the writers of his age.</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c000'>It is not until one undertakes seriously the collecting
of the less-known Victorian novelists that one realizes
how prime the sport that their assembling offers, how
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>destitute of guide-posts is the maze of their work. In
the capacity of quarry few authors or groups of authors
can rival those with whom this volume deals. The
essence of collecting is the chase. The buyer of world-famous
rarities, of which the whereabouts is trumpeted
abroad, knows nothing of the thrill of that dusky provincial
bookshop, among whose tumbled piles Victorians
must surely lurk. The dapper expert in ingenious
moderns with his prefaces, his cancel-titles, his censored
(but disappointing) curiosa, his “works” and
“limiteds,” can set one joy alone against my dozen. He
may, if the gods be kind, on the shelves of bookshops
proper find books that were bought for new, but have not
sold and still remain, lacking an entry to the world of
second-hand, still fresh, still offered at the published
price. But in the main his life is one of “inside information”;
his ally in the trade sells books instead of
making them; it is the principle of the turf in terms of
Whatman paper and grey Michalet boards. To the
collector of Victorians (exception made, of course, of
Dickens's parts, of <cite>Wuthering Heights</cite>, of <cite>Desperate
Remedies</cite>, of other far reputed treasures) belongs neither
the pursuit of “folios” across the world nor the click
of the tape pegging out details of obscure pamphlets.
Copies of three-volume novels by writers of reputation
are hard to find at all, and very hard in anything of condition.
Nevertheless, when found, they are often cheap.
And then, when one is bought, there comes the reading
of it.</p>

<p class='c000'>And yet at times the collector feels forlorn and without
guidance, for maybe the book he buys is a little
known one, of which the very name is strange. Indeed,
the lack of pointers obtrudes harshly, and in a sense no
less literary than bibliographical. Not only is information
as to actual titles scarce and unreliable, but among the
great number of these writers' books the student must
perforce read his own way to a sense of relative quality.
At the cost of some hours of tedium and of many mistaken
purchases I have arrived at a general knowledge
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>of what these novelists wrote, when they wrote it, and
what it looked like when it first appeared. This knowledge
is herein set out for the possible assistance of all
and sundry.</p>

<p class='c000'>The relative value as literature or as story-telling of
their many books makes more perilous judgment. I am
no expert in comparative literature. I cannot even claim
to have read all or nearly all the books that are, in the
pages following, materially dissected. I have preferred
therefore to make no pretence to serious literary criticism,
but have contented myself with indicating at the beginning
of each section the general character of the work
of the writer in question, into what groups (if any) his
novels fall, and have called attention here and there to
certain little known or unknown stories that have pleased
me and may, though hardly for that reason, please some
of my contemporaries. Where an author has little
attraction for me, I have said so. Books of all kinds are
listed between these covers, and no single being will
enjoy them all. But this is certain: that among them
the inquirer, be his tastes what they may, will find reading
to soothe him and to stimulate; will come to seek in
the solidity, whether downright, fantastic, or lurid, in
the quiet charm, in the dexterous sincerity of good Victorian
fiction, a satisfaction of spirit produced by the
novels of no other period of English literature.</p>

<p class='c000'>Those who for years have known and pondered these
Victorian tales will smile contemptuously at such pompous
revelation of a stale secret. To them, in scorn of
self and lest they lose any of that pleasurable pride
allowable to old initiates who watch a novice at his
scourgings, I offer the apology that is my book. Others,
arrogant in knowledge of Dickensiana, in possession of
priceless Borrows, of Jane Austen perfect in her boards,
will turn from this humble chronicle of humble writers
with the bored serenity of a brass hat on his way to conference.
To them I make obeisance, wondering secretly
whether great collections were amassed more joyfully
than my little one. Last of all, however, may come a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>few, to whom, as to me, Trollope is balm and meat at
once, who love three volumes of a novel for their very
spacing and ornate expansiveness, who find shelves of
cloth or labelled triplets more beautiful than any other
shelves, to whom, in short, the collection and the reading
of Victorian first editions is romance and quiet happiness.
To them my book with all its faults will come
kindly and joyfully, for they will welcome in it the voice
of one who thinks and loves, as they do, the plaint of
one suffering from the same sweet sickness as themselves.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>A NOTE ON THE TERMS USED IN THE BIBLIOGRAPHIES WHICH FOLLOW<br /> <br /> <span class='large'>TOGETHER WITH OBSERVATIONS RELATIVE TO VICTORIAN BOOKMAKING, RECOMMENDATIONS TO COLLECTORS, AND AN APPEAL TO THE EXPERIENCE OF OTHER STUDENTS FOR ASSISTANCE AND CORRECTION</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>(i) I am aware that bibliographers proper designate by
means of upright strokes the alignment of wording on
the title-pages of books subject to their analysis. This
mannerism I have eschewed, and for two reasons. In
the first place, a bibliography so displayed baffles the
inexpert reader by a suggestion of mathematical
obscurity. Tempted by the desire to attract a few such
readers to a book that, for all its overplus of sinew and
lack of flesh, is in intention a tribute to a group of very
human and consoling writers, I have sought an appearance
of readability at the cost of a small technical sacrifice.
The sacrifice <em>is</em> small—and here lies the second
justification of my heterodox technique—because no
variety of any one of the books hereafter listed depends
either on the alignment of title-page wording or (save in
a single case to which attention is specially drawn) on
the phrasing, absence or presence of a note of reservation
of foreign or dramatic rights. In short, that which is
required for the identification of a first edition I have
given; but beyond that—nothing.</p>

<p class='c000'>(ii) The first editions of almost any author include, in
addition to books written wholly by him, a number of
works for some part of which only he is responsible.
These secondary items cannot be neglected by collectors,
for any <em>book</em> in which for the first time is published an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>essay, a story, a poem, or what not by one particular
writer ranks as a first edition of that writer. Naturally,
however, complete works take precedence over partial
works, and I have grouped at the end of each section of
this book such partial or minor first editions as I have
been able to identify.</p>

<p class='c000'>It must be clearly understood that first <em>magazine</em> publication
is not here referred to. The only periodical issue
of a book that can rank with book issue is that in
<em>parts</em>, according to which the text of a novel made its
appearance in monthly or weekly sections, separately
wrappered, under its own title and unaccompanied by
any extraneous matter save advertisements. Part issues
are essential to a collector; on the other hand, the numbers
of magazines in which this story or that made serial
appearance may be ignored. In many cases I have
stated where (if anywhere) novels were serialized, but
such information is of general rather than of collecting
interest, save to those whose catholicity of taste and
house-room permit them the luxury of adding sets of
magazines to those of actual books.</p>

<p class='c000'>(iii) The terms used to-day to describe sizes in
uncut books vary from those of an earlier period. For
example, the terms “Post 8vo” and “12mo” are now
rarely met with, whereas prior to 1880 they were in
regular and common currency. Fearing that the modern
buyer or seller of books would be puzzled by too frequent
an encounter with technicalities virtually obsolete,
I have expressed book sizes in terms familiar to present-day
ears and as nearly equivalent to those replaced as
makes no matter. The “8vo” book of the fifties is the
“Demy 8vo” of the nineteen-twenties; “Post 8vo” has
become “Extra Crown 8vo”; “12mo” has become
“Foolscap 8vo.” The phraseology adopted, being
familiar, will give an immediate general idea of a book's
dimensions; the measurement in inches, given in
brackets in all but a handful of cases, will supply to an
eighth of an inch any further detail required.</p>

<p class='c000'>(iv) The half-title is something of a bugbear to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>collector of Victorians. Its absence may be fatal; its
presence may give pause. As the nineteenth century
progressed, methods of bookmaking became standardized;
but during the first fifty years publishers printed to
paper and their own convenience, regardless of uniformity
even between volumes of the same work. For
this reason no certainty exists as to the possession by
any book of a half-title. Usually examination will show
whether, in a book lacking a half-title, the first sheet
should rightly provide one or no. The publisher who
found his preliminary matter adequate, without half-title,
for four or eight pages, let it go at that; if, however,
he had two pages of his four or eight to spare, he
used them for half-title and verso. Wherever in the
notes that follow I have satisfied myself that an absence
of half-title is correct, I have drawn attention to that
absence; wherever nothing is said, the silence should be
taken to signify that in perfect copies half-titles must
appear.</p>

<p class='c000'>(v) In the matter of binding it was the custom from
about 1830 to 1850 to issue many books both in cloth and
in paper boards. The old fashion for boards and labels
died hard, and doubtless the trade found it paid to
humour at once the enthusiast for the new cloth and the
conservative lover of ancient ways. The collector who
has the choice of a book either in cloth or in boards (with
which must be understood boards, half-cloth<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c014'><sup>[1]</sup></a>) and lacks
either inclination or money to buy the two should, if
condition be equally good, buy the copy in boards.
Such a copy <em>may be</em> of earlier but <em>cannot</em> be of later issue
than one in cloth. Should the book be one of which the
two styles were issued simultaneously the copies will rank
equally, although even in such cases a board copy is
preferable, seeing that probably fewer were published
than of those in cloth, and certainly fewer have survived.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f1'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r1'>1</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>For convenience' sake the word “cloth” is used throughout
these bibliographies to signify woven material used in binding.
Technically, in the transition period between bound books and
those fully bound, half-binding was carried out in “canvas,” cloth
proper being of somewhat later date.</p>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>The phrase “boards (half-cloth) paper labels” is used
in these bibliographies to describe books which may be
found <em>both</em> in full-board <em>and</em> half-cloth styles. The
colours of board and canvas vary greatly, as different
tones were often used for books belonging to one edition.</p>

<p class='c000'>(vi) It will be noticed that in the majority of cases I
give the <em>month</em> as well as the year of a novel's publication.
This, had it been possible, I would wish to
have supplied throughout, for by its help alone can the
vexed question of dated catalogues be properly determined.
Unfortunately, with the disappearance <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">in toto</span></i>
of many publishing firms, the absorption of others under
new names, and the surprising lack of any complete files
of lists and catalogues for the decades in question, it has
been impossible in every case to fix the dates thus
accurately. In determining the various issues of a first
edition (for a publisher does not bind his whole printing
at once, but in lots as required, and often at intervals of
years), the date, if any, of the catalogues of publications
generally bound at the end of Victorian novels is an
essential factor. Where I give the month of publication
in the pages that follow, there can be no difficulty in
detecting copies bound up and issued after first publication.
Elsewhere buyers can only be advised to compare
the date of title-page with that of catalogue. If the latter
predates or tallies with the former all <em>may</em> be well; if the
catalogue date be later, the book is not a first issue,
although still, so far as the sheets are concerned, a copy
of the first edition. In a few rare cases, where numerous
catalogues were printed during the same year, the
earliest date found in any particular first edition of that
year can be established only by experience. It is for this
reason that identity of year between title-page and catalogue
<em>may</em> rather than <em>must</em> indicate a true first issue.</p>

<p class='c000'>(vii) Advice as to condition is easily given.</p>

<p class='c000'>Never buy a rebound book or one of which the edges
have been shaved.<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c014'><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>

<div class='footnote' id='f2'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r2'>2</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In this, as always, generalization fails. The vast majority of
the books here listed were first issued <em>uncut</em>; there are, however, a
few—and those among the books of later date—that were published
cut. The collector can identify these, if in original binding,
by comparing measurement with that here given.</p>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>Be wary of books in cloth which bear no publisher's
imprint on the spine; a few are right, but the majority
are remainder-bound. Only in the very early days of
cloth binding were spines unimprinted. Of course
<em>labelled</em> books, whether in boards or half-cloth, never
show publishers' imprint at the tail of their spines.</p>

<p class='c000'>Always examine end-papers. The quality of Victorian
end-papers cannot be obtained to-day, and it is
rare that the substitution in one book of an old end-paper
from another is so neatly done as to defy detection.</p>

<p class='c000'>Library labels and their horrid traces have no place in
a fine copy. If, however, a buyer inclines to accept
ex-library copies pending better fortune, he should prefer
those marked <em>inside</em> front covers to those of which the
actual cloth is disfigured. Should the choice be between
a copy in disfigured cloth and one of which the cloth is
clean but the end-papers renewed to obliterate some previous
damage, the wise buyer will take the first and
leave the second. Better a dirty original than a book
neat but doctored.</p>

<p class='c000'>Do not reject an otherwise good copy of a book because
the case is loose or the back-stitching perished. Such
deterioration is easily and painlessly repaired.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the case of books illustrated with etchings or steel
engravings, compare the date often to be found on the
plates with that on the title-page. These dates should
tally, or, if they do not, thought or examination of
prefatory matter should show the reason why.</p>

<p class='c000'>Several cases exist of books reissued more than once,
but without printed indication of reissue, in a style
identical with that of the first edition. In such cases the
plates, more often than not, bear their silent witness, and
the careful buyer, momentarily uncertain of his dates, is
saved the purchase of a book he does not want.</p>

<p class='c000'>(viii) The volumes listed which I have not myself
seen and examined are asterisked<a id='asterisked'></a> and thus expressly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>noted as catalogued without personal investigation. As
may be imagined, some of the obscurer works of the
authors dealt with are extremely rare, and all my seeking
has failed to discover some of them. In every other
case personal handling has preceded analysis, even
although collation may already have existed in published
form.</p>

<p class='c000'>(ix) In conclusion I would appeal to any reader of my
book who can emend, develop, or dispute the statements
therein contained to send me forthwith his criticisms and
suggestions. To work of this kind can be no finality.
Freak copies, copies containing catalogues of earlier
date, copies in earlier varieties of binding—of such things
is the sport of bibliography composed. No individual
can be sure that one particular issue of any book is the
earliest; comparative certainty comes only from cooperation.
Wherever possible I have compared several
copies of the same book, but this was by no means everywhere.
Consequently to look forward to revision and
yet more revision is, in the circumstances, a matter for
hope rather than one for shame.</p>

<div class='chapter'>

  <h2 class='c006'>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Perhaps the most pleasant element in the compiling of
this book has been the generosity and enthusiasm with
which persons able to help have responded to inquiries.</p>

<p class='c000'>Among those who have contributed of their private
knowledge facts that but for them I could never have
discovered, Mr. Richard Bentley must have first place.
Unique as an authority on Victorian publishing, Mr.
Bentley not only replied promptly and in detail to my
importunate inquiries, but made suggestions and gave
information—often at considerable personal trouble—which
have greatly extended the scope and utility of my
book.</p>

<p class='c000'>Other publishers and editors were no less ready to give
me access to such records of the past as were still in their
keeping. To Mr. Arthur Waugh (of Messrs. Chapman
and Hall), to Mr. Kelk and to Mr. Barnard (of Messrs.
Longmans, Green), to Mr. Spalding (of Messrs. Chatto
and Windus), to Mr. Herbert Virtue (of Messrs. Virtue
and Co.), to Mr. Farquharson and to Mr. Leonard
Huxley (of Messrs. John Murray), to Mr. Marston (of
the “Publishers' Circular”), I tender my best thanks.</p>

<p class='c000'>Gratitude must next be expressed to booksellers and
owners of books whose contribution differed in kind but
not in degree from that of the foregoing. Mr. Walter
Spencer put his unrivalled stock of Victorian first editions
wholly at my disposal, thus enabling me to examine
many rare items not elsewhere discoverable. He also
lent me a series of autograph letters from which certain
details were obtainable. To Messrs. Bain and Messrs.
Maggs I owe opportunities of seeing books necessary to
my list. Mr. Hugh Walpole gave me access to his
private collection, and Mr. Cecil Davis, Mr. J. A. Green,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>and Mr. Clement Shorter helped to a clearer understanding
of the bibliography of Captain Marryat and of
Mrs. Gaskell.</p>

<p class='c000'>Further, I should like to set down my appreciation of
the facilities afforded to me by the authorities of the
British Museum and of the Bodleian Library. Their
willingness to shorten in my favour the tedious process
of extracting scattered volumes from their stores and
vaults saved much fatigue and hours of valuable time.</p>

<p class='c000'>To my mother, to my wife, and to one of my publishers
I owe thanks for friendly collaboration at points where
two heads and four hands had more than twice the value
of half their number. Lastly, and perhaps mostly, I am
indebted, for secretarial assistance and for help in the
labour of research, to Miss Martha Smith, whose accuracy
and devotion have halved my personal toil.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>ANTHONY TROLLOPE<br /> <span class='large'>1815-1882</span></h2>

    <div>ANTHONY TROLLOPE<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c014'><sup>[3]</sup></a></div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c012'>Trollope's novels, like those of Jane Austen, are of the
very essence of fiction. Whatever they may lack in
verbal subtlety, in passion, in tragedy or in comedy of
idea, they never lack that spiritual skeleton without
which no structure of a story-teller's imagining can
survive. Palaces more delicate, more romantic, more
brilliant and more terrible than those of Trollope have
been erected and have stood to win the admiration of
posterity; but their splendour and their beauty are due
more to the solid material that upholds their walls and
roofs than to the skill and fancy of their decoration.
Other palaces, because they lacked such invisible but
vital solidity, have drawn for an hour the fickle favour
of the crowd and then toppled into dust. It is easy, in
fiction, to create a nine days' wonder, but hard indeed
to win the esteem of ninety years.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f3'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r3'>3</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>For his consent to the reprinting of this Essay I am grateful
to the Editor of the “Nineteenth Century and After.”</p>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Trollope has achieved that victory. Oblivion can now
never be his, for he has lived his bad times and survived.
As must any artist worth the name, he suffered eclipse—temporary,
indeed, but so severe as at one time to
threaten permanence. He was scorned as dowdy and
parochial by the brilliant metropolitans of a succeeding
generation. Only in the hearts of quiet folk and among
readers uninstructed in the genius of their own time were
his books remembered and cherished.</p>

<p class='c000'>Until, slowly and slowly, opinion has begun to
change. Quality has outstayed vogue, and the latter
comes smirking back to the smiles of a lover yesterday
despised. Indeed, Trollope is in a fair way to become
once again the fashion. For a while he will be honoured
by the enthusiasm of the intellectuals. Then, when they
have turned their volatile benevolence to some other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>quarter, he will settle firmly in the respect of the critical.
And that will at once be fame and his deserts.</p>

<p class='c000'>Any summary analysis of Trollope's individual novels
is wellnigh impossible, in view not only of the bulk of
his work but also of its scope and richness of content.
His quality is more intangible and at the same time more
concentrated than that of the other writers treated in this
book. “Of all the needs a book has, the chief need is that
it be readable,” wrote Trollope himself. And again:
“The primary object of a novelist is to please.” Readability
has, in these latter days, become a term of condescension.
But that is the fault of a superior age, and
for the ten who use the word contemptuously there are
ten thousand who, did they care to do so, would give it
an older and a more honourable meaning. To them, as
always to the large public of novel-readers, fiction, when
it is not costume-romance, mystery-story, or topical
propaganda, is a revelation of their own lives. It is this
demand for an expression of emotions in which the
normal reader can share that Trollope so amazingly
satisfies. No précis of plot, no indication of social
setting, of character types, nor of period, can in his case
convey the essence of any particular novel.</p>

<p class='c000'>Nevertheless his stories fall into certain specific categories,
some of which form actual series of tales with
characters reappearing from volume to volume, while
others, although severally independent and self-contained,
may be classified as belonging to one type of
fiction or to another.</p>

<p class='c000'>The best known group of novels is that dealing with
the society of the city of Barchester and of the surrounding
neighbourhood. <cite>The Chronicles of Barsetshire</cite>, as
they have been called, are six in number:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='sc'>The Warden</span> (1855),</div>

      <div class='line'><span class='sc'>Doctor Thorne</span> (1858),</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='sc'>Framley Parsonage</span> (1861),</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='sc'>The Small House at Allington</span> (1864), and</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='sc'>The Last Chronicle of Barset</span> (1867).</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>Although these famous stories undoubtedly contain
much of Trollope's best work, they do not contain the
whole of it. It is a mistake to suppose that they rank
altogether higher than his other books, and one of the
most disastrous results of the disfavour into which his
novels fell after their author's death is that a wealth of
really first-rate material, just because it is included in
books of which the late eighties chose to forget the titles,
lies hidden to-day and withdrawn from the enjoyment of
modern readers.</p>

<p class='c000'>Cases of such unmerited neglect are encountered immediately
and among the novels of Trollope's second
continuous and interconnected series. The “political”
stories, like those of Barsetshire, are six in number:</p>

<p class='c000'>It is truly remarkable to what an extent these admirable
tales have fallen into oblivion. Not only do they
introduce many of Trollope's most masterly characters,
but they present, vividly and with knowledge, the minds
and manners of the political aristocracy, the social
hangers-on, the Tadpoles and Tapers of the day. Speaking
generally, the social setting of the political novels is
different from that of <cite>The Chronicles of Barsetshire</cite>. Indeed,
it could hardly be otherwise, seeing that the whole
series takes its tone from the personalities of Plantagenet
Palliser and his wife Lady Glencora, who, as the stories
progress and by natural course of inheritance, become
the Duke and Duchess of Omnium and the greatest of
English nobility. Trollope's method is not slavishly to
serialize the life story of any individual character or pair
of characters. All the political novels have their own
clearly defined plot. They are, however, all tinged with
the compelling personalities of Lady Glencora and her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>husband, into which Trollope threw all that he had of
art and enthusiasm.</p>

<p class='c000'><cite>Can You Forgive Her?</cite> is a long novel, concerned
primarily with the troubles of a motherless girl who
breaks an engagement with an oppressively upright man
in order to return to a youthful love affair with a
dissipated and unscrupulous cousin. Mr. Grey, the
honourable man, gets in the end the wife he wants; but
Trollope does not hesitate to show fairly the preference
of a high-spirited girl for an adventurous rascal, and
there will be many who, when the book is finished, will
regret—a little ashamedly—that virtue has ultimately
triumphed. In the life story of Lady Glencora <cite>Can You
Forgive Her?</cite> is important, for it pictures her newly
married and literally on the verge of running away from
her shy, proud, inarticulate husband, with a beautiful
young reprobate, whose previous intimacy with her the
reader may imagine at his discretion. The fallibility of
Lady Glencora is skilfully contrasted with that of Alice
Vavasor, the heroine of the book; their circumstances are
so similar, and yet the young women react to them so
differently!</p>

<p class='c000'><cite>Phineas Finn</cite> is a tale of political ambition. The
hero, by whose name the book is called, is a poor Irishman
who comes to seek his fortune in Parliament. The
ups and downs of his career; Lady Laura Kennedy, who
loves him but from family pressure marries millions;
Madame Max Goesler, the fascinating, mysterious widow
who rejects flattering if dubious proposals from the old
Duke of Omnium, combine with a mass of other material
to make a really dramatic story that is continued, and
equally well continued, in <cite>Phineas Redux</cite>.</p>

<p class='c000'>Not the least remarkable feature of the second<a id='first'></a> of these
two books is the hero's trial for murder. Trollope has a
genius for trial scenes, and to my mind it is an open
question whether that in <cite>Phineas Redux<a id='Finn'></a></cite> is not finer than
its more celebrated predecessors in <cite>The Three Clerks</cite>
and in <cite>Orley Farm</cite>.</p>

<p class='c000'><cite>The Eustace Diamonds</cite> turns on the personality of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>Lizzie Eustace, a selfish but attractive little woman who
keeps possession, in the teeth of lawyers and of her late
husband's relations, of certain priceless jewels to which
she has no right whatever. There are two or three subplots
in the story, all of good quality; but the character
of Lizzie Eustace, who, for all her lying and her insincerity
and her cheap smartness, is seductive and appealing,
stands out as the book's essential achievement.</p>

<p class='c000'><cite>The Prime Minister</cite> and <cite>The Duke's Children</cite> are the
only two novels of the political series in which Plantagenet
Palliser, now Duke of Omnium, is admittedly the
central figure. The former book is so constructed as to
give prominence to the love affair and unhappy marriage
of Emily Wharton with Ferdinand Lopez, a stock
gambler and commercial adventurer. But although the
history of the Lopez <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ménage</span> is admirably told, and gives
scope for the reintroduction of Lizzie Eustace, as well as
other strange and disreputable people, the story of the
first premiership of the Duke of Omnium is the real story
of the book. By the time he came to the writing of <cite>The
Prime Minister</cite>, Trollope had become deeply interested
in presenting in the person of the Duke his ideal conception
of an English aristocrat. No praise can be too high
for the skill with which he implies, but does not describe,
the divergent qualities of ambition possessed by the
Duke and by his wife. Throughout the book she is for
ever striving to make him in the eye of the world the
greatest gentleman of the greatest kingdom of all time.
He, on the other hand, sees in his position only duty and
responsibility and disappointment. Not the least of his
troubles are his wife's insistence that the life of a public
man is never private, and her expressed conviction that
give and take is the essence of political compromise and
therefore of premiership.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the interval between <cite>The Prime Minister</cite> and <cite>The
Duke's Children</cite> the Duchess of Omnium dies. The
unhappy Duke is left to find, if he may, in the achievements
of his children that completeness and success to
secure which he feels that he has himself so utterly failed.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>Everything goes awry. His only daughter gives her
love to an unknown and penniless commoner. His
younger son, after ragging through his university career,
resorts disastrously to cards and racing. Finally, his
heir—Lord Silverbridge—stands for Parliament in the
opposite interest to that of his father, and, worse still,
turns from the girl the Duke has chosen as his bride, in
order to throw his title and prospects at the feet of the
beautiful daughter of an American savant. The Duke
struggles against his own humanity; slowly and unhappily,
as is his way, he adjusts himself to the changing
times; at the last he sacrifices his ideals of nobility to
personal affection. <cite>The Duke's Children</cite> worthily closes
a series of fine novels. In some ways this last story of
the political group is the best, and it speaks a good deal
for the author's power of sustained imagination that he
contrived, over a period of sixteen years, to maintain the
interest and develop the vitality of so complex a collection
of characters.</p>

<p class='c000'>The rough classifications of novels in themselves independent
may, out of respect for chronology, begin with
the stories of Irish life. <cite>The Macdermotts of Ballycloran</cite>
(1847), <cite>The Kellys and the O'Kellys</cite> (1848), <cite>Castle
Richmond</cite> (1860) and <cite>The Landleaguers</cite> (1883), are the
four books which belong, properly speaking, to this
category. Of course there are Irish scenes in many
other novels, for Trollope lived for years in Ireland,
knew it well and loved it, and was for ever introducing
Irishmen and Irish incidents into his work. The books
above mentioned are, however, wholly and deliberately
novels about Ireland. The first two have the faults of
very early work, in that they are prolix and lack that
control of character and material that marks the experienced
novelist. Both, however, are worth reading, and
the plot of <cite>The Kellys</cite> needs no excuse on the score of
inexperience. <cite>Castle Richmond</cite>, however, is definitely
an unsuccessful book. It is packed with information
about the Irish famine, and the story is over-melodramatic
for Trollope's method. One of his most characteristic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>qualities as a novelist is his refusal to keep the
reader in suspense. In direct contrast to Wilkie Collins,
he goes out of his way to explain, as he comes to it, each
seemingly inexplicable event. It is as though he scorns
to save himself the trouble of characterization by erecting
between himself and the reader a screen of mystery.
For this reason, the secret power exercised by the unsavoury
Molletts over Sir Thomas Fitzgerald is, because
it soon ceases to be secret, a weak foundation upon
which to erect a story. <cite>The Landleaguers</cite>, the book left
unfinished by Trollope when he died, is concerned to
present the social condition of Ireland in the early
eighties, as was <cite>Castle Richmond</cite> to depict that of the
famine-ridden forties. And yet what a difference! In
<cite>The Landleaguers</cite> the novelist presents his picture of
politics in his actual story. There are no passages of
blue-book instructionalism, but it is doubtful whether a
more vivid impression of the state of Ireland at the time
can be obtained from any other source. Even if there
were no others among Trollope's old-age novels to disprove
the theory, <cite>The Landleaguers</cite> alone should put
an end to the contention that toward the end of his life
he had lost his cunning or written himself out.</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c000'>It is now necessary to examine that large and heterogeneous
collection of novels which, from one point of
view or another, satirize contemporary life or present
some definite aspect of the English social scene. Let me
once more insist that the classification of Trollope's
books here attempted should not be understood too
literally. All the Barchester novels, all the political
novels, are in one sense wholly presentments of society;
in the same way many of them contain passages definitely
satirical. But they have other claims to special
grouping which the numerous isolated stories now to be
considered do not possess; and, while satire is mainly
incidental to the tales of Barchester and to those of
political life, it is in some at least of Trollope's other
books the principal purpose of the story.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>First, then, the books which may fairly be termed
books of social satire. The earliest in date is <cite>The
Bertrams</cite>, which, although the situations and characters
are of the kind which Trollope was to make
essentially his own, is a failure even more complete than
<cite>Castle Richmond</cite>. The central theme is one to which
the author more than once returns. Caroline Waddington
rejects George Bertram for reasons of income and
prospects. She marries his successful lawyer friend,
only to find that she has sold herself to a greedy tyrant.
The parallel case of Julia Brabazon and Harry Clavering
immediately suggests itself; but where in <cite>The Claverings</cite>
Trollope achieves an intense humanity, in <cite>The
Bertrams</cite> he is dully mechanical. He allows the subsidiary
plots to disturb and obscure his main story.
When, as frequently, he attempts the comic in social
enjoyment he comes clumsily to grief. The widow's
seaside picnic in <cite>Can you Forgive Her?</cite> has only to be
contrasted with the excursion from Jerusalem described
in <cite>The Bertrams</cite> to make clear the difference between
successful and unsuccessful satire. And yet there are
points in <cite>The Bertrams</cite>. The close-fisted old man, the
disposal of whose money provides the motive of most
of the incident, is drawn with consistent restraint.
There are touches in the description of society at Littlebath
that prepare the reader for the pleasure of <cite>Miss
Mackenzie</cite>. On the whole the book should be read. It
is Trollope “off” (or rather “not yet on to”) his game,
but it was published at an important moment in his
career and helps to make clear his subsequent development.</p>

<p class='c000'><cite>Rachel Ray</cite> (1863) and <cite>Miss Mackenzie</cite> (1865) may,
without any critical licence, be considered together.
Both are bitter satires on Evangelical Christianity.
Trollope inherited from his mother a hatred of the
brimstone school of religious teachers, and in these
novels he lets himself go with considerable effect. The
earlier of the two books contains comparatively few
characters, and those of modest social position. Rachel
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>herself is delightful and gives to the book, despite its
obvious weaknesses of construction, a freshness and
charm that is very pleasing. Mrs. Prime and her
horrible clerical admirer are frankly caricature, but that
they should be so is not unnatural, seeing that they
represent the very puritanism that the book is intended
to attack.</p>

<p class='c000'>In <cite>Miss Mackenzie</cite> we are given the story of a spinster
of thirty-five, to whom unexpectedly a small fortune
is bequeathed. She becomes immediately the quarry of
fortune hunters—shabby social, religious, and commercial.
Some of the best scenes in the story are staged in
Littlebath, where Miss Todd and Miss Baker (who help
to retrieve <cite>The Bertrams</cite> from disaster) make welcome
reappearance. As satire the novel is more dexterous
than <cite>Rachel Ray</cite>, but it lacks the attraction of a real
Trollope heroine, and throughout has a faint tinge of
the sordid. It is interesting to note on page 242 of the
second volume a mention of Lady Glencora Palliser,
whom Trollope had 'presented' in<a id='invented'></a> <cite>Can you Forgive Her?</cite></p>

<p class='c000'>Not until 1875 did Trollope publish another definitely
satirical novel. When he did so, the event marked an
important stage in his evolution as a novelist. Critics
had begun to grumble at comedies of manners, which
spoke of the suavity of yesterday rather than of the competitive
hustle of to-day. England was moving step by
step along the road to commercialism. Trollope, with
his county and clerical families, his political aristocrats
and comic tuft-hunters, was shrugged aside as out of
date. Such treatment was intolerable, and, with a
gesture half impatient, half appealing, he sent out into
the world <cite>The Way We Live Now</cite>. This long and
crowded novel—perhaps, with the exception of <cite>The Last
Chronicle of Barset</cite>, the most abundant of all his books—presents,
in the person of Mr. Melmotte, the financial
magnate of alien origin proper to a truly modern story
of English life. Whether the cavillers, whose complaints
spurred Trollope to so violent an effort, admitted,
after reading <cite>The Way We Live Now</cite>, that the old dog
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>could in truth out-modern the best of them, history does
not relate; but undeniably this book, in which he
asserted his vitality and showed that in the matter of
satiric observation he was well abreast of the times, has
no lack of vigour or luxuriant invention.</p>

<p class='c000'>That <cite>Mr. Scarborough's Family</cite> (1883) may reasonably
be said to conclude the list of Trollope's satirical
novels is perhaps disputable. And yet, because its
power is mainly ironic, I prefer to mention it here rather
than treat of it as a purely social story. A while ago
one example was quoted of a first-rate book from
Trollope's last period. <cite>Mr. Scarborough's Family</cite> is
another.</p>

<p class='c000'>An aged and wealthy cynic suddenly (and, as it turns
out, with deliberate falsehood) makes public the illegitimacy
of his eldest son. With the complications of
inheritance, with the changing relations between old
Mr. Scarborough and his two sons, of whom the elder is
now destitute and the latter coldly triumphant in his
unexpected good fortune, is involved an elaborate second
plot, centring round the love story of an amiable young
man, whose fortunes depend on the favour of a peevish
and eccentric uncle. Analysis of a tale so full of
happening and character is impossible in a few lines.
Sufficient to say that <cite>Mr. Scarborough's Family</cite>, were
it not for the date on its title-page, might be thought to
belong to a much earlier period, not only of Trollope,
but of fiction as a whole, to a period more lavish than
subtle, more genial and full-blooded than detached and
sensitive.</p>

<p class='c000'>With <cite>The Three Clerks</cite> (1858) opens the chronology
of those novels which, although partially satirical, are
in the main straightforward stories of English cultivated
life. <cite>The Three Clerks</cite> is one of the few Trollope
novels that has been seriously overrated. In its pages
Mr. Chaffanbrass, the notorious Old Bailey lawyer,
makes his first appearance, but he is infinitely more
effective in <cite>Orley Farm</cite> and in <cite>Phineas Finn</cite> than at his
first entrance on the Trollope stage. In so far as <cite>The</cite>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span><cite>Three Clerks</cite> gives a picture of the Civil Service that the
author himself knew, it has documentary value, but as
fiction it is formless and flaccid. Its young women are
wholly devoid of that freshness and frankness that place
Trollope, as a creator of femininity, apart from all other
novelists of his generation; its menfolk are either riotous
dummies like those in Smedley's novels, or prigs and
villains, compounded so slavishly by recipe as to have
little meaning beyond that of the conventional types
they represent.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of <cite>Orley Farm</cite> (1862) it is unnecessary to speak, the
novel being one of the two or three outside the Barchester
series which are still read to-day. <cite>The Belton
Estate</cite> (1866), on the other hand, badly needs rehabilitation.
Henry James, in a review written when quite a
young man, concluded a long paragraph of hostile
criticism with the words: “<cite>The Belton Estate</cite> is a stupid
book.” One may venture that the obtuseness was not
all on one side. Using a cast of four principal and as
few subsidiary characters, Trollope fills three good
volumes with the matrimonial dilemma of Clara Amedroz,
who has to choose between the uncouth, well-to-do
farmer to whom passes her thriftless father's estate, and
the polished, self-seeking Captain Aylmer—in parlance,
though not in fact, also her cousin—who offers her marriage
because at the deathbed of his rich aunt and as part
condition of becoming her heir he swore to do so. <cite>The
Belton Estate</cite> has, to a greater degree than any other
of Trollope's books, that art of concealing art which
delights one type of mind, but by another is dismissed
as “stupid.” In a sense it is the most difficult to
appreciate of all the important novels, and, were an
examination in Trollope a thing of practical import, the
examining board would be wise to make this book the
test question of their paper.</p>

<p class='c000'><cite>The Claverings</cite> (1867) and <cite>He Knew He Was Right</cite>
(1869) are very long books, each of which turns on a
theme highly characteristic of the author. Mention has
already been made of Julia Brabazon, heroine of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>former book, who jilts the nobody she loves for a rich
invalid peer. The price she has to pay is counted in
full in the pages of <cite>The Claverings</cite>, which also introduce
a number of excellent characters, from Sir Hugh
Clavering, hard, savage, and selfish, to Sophie Gordeloup
and her scoundrelly brother, who play so desperately
for the wealth and person of Lord Ongar's lonely and
embittered widow. <cite>He Knew He Was Right</cite> describes
the steady growth in a husband's mind of unjust suspicion
of his wife's fidelity. As a crescendo of hysterical
mistrust, the book is a fine piece of sustained
writing. As a novel, it would be gloomy and distressing
but for an admirable and humorous by-plot laid
in cathedral Exeter. It would, perhaps, be hypercritical
and unappreciative of his adroit handling of incident to
blame the author for the very liberal use of coincidence
with which he aids the progress of his story.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of the six social novels that remain, one is first-rate,
three are very good second-rate, one is ordinary second-rate
and the last frankly bad. <cite>Is He Popenjoy?</cite> (1878)
may rank with <cite>The Claverings</cite> as a book undeservedly
excluded from the upper room of every Trollope-lover's
mind. The Dean of Brotherton, son of a jobmaster,
father of the heroine and ultimately grandfather of a
marquis, is a Trollope dignitary of the first water. His
daughter is as eminent in the world of heroines as is
her father in that of ecclesiastics. She is gay, loving,
whimsical, courageous, and always natural. Her dour
husband with his excessive sense of duty and inadequate
sense of humour; her aristocratic sisters-in-law, shrouding
in ill-nature and good works the emptiness of their
lives and purses; the society siren; the society matchmaker;
and perhaps above all the ill-tempered, dissolute
marquis, on the legitimacy of whose son turns the whole
mechanism of the story, are each one of them fictional
characters that only a master could create.</p>

<p class='c000'><cite>Ralph The Heir</cite> (1871)—the plot of which was pirated
by Charles Reade and dramatized under the title <cite>Shilly
Shally</cite>—contains some good characters and perhaps the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>best parliamentary election of all those contrived by its
author. The troubles and difficulties of the shy, ineffective
Sir Thomas Underwood, and the determination of
Mr. Neefit, the breeches-maker, to buy up a bankrupt
young squire as husband for his daughter would give
distinction to any story. <cite>Lady Anna</cite> (1874) is a delicate
elaboration of Trollope's favourite motif—projected or
(as in this case) actual misalliance. <cite>The American
Senator</cite> (1877) contains some excellent hunting and
much good general observation. <cite>Ayala's Angel</cite> (1881),
like <cite>The Belton Estate</cite> but less pronouncedly, is a book
that must be read to be realized, for it is quiet Trollope
and a thing of shades rather than one of definite, contrasted
colours.</p>

<p class='c000'>There remains <cite>Marion Fay</cite> (1882), once again a tale
of misalliance. This is undeniably the worst book that
its author ever wrote. Everywhere but here he contrives
to keep either his hero or his heroine (and more frequently
both) sympathetic, sensible, and convincingly
normal; but in <cite>Marion Fay</cite> he sinks to mawkishness and
to a deathbed scene that is frankly inexcusable.</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c000'>Plenty of novels still remain of this astonishing and
untiring writer. They may, however, be somewhat
summarily dismissed. The most interesting group is
that of the short, single-theme stories which succeeded
the publication of <cite>The Way We Live Now</cite>. It is not
unreasonable to attribute to the mood of challenge in
which that novel was sent out the noticeable change in
the author's method during the years that followed. It
is as though he had determined to try his hand at the
psychological analysis which was just coming into
fashion among novelists. And so we are given in quick
succession six little books, each written round a single
event or describing the reactions of one individual to a
definite set of circumstances. The titles are as follow:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='sc'>An Eye for An Eye</span> (1879),</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='sc'>Cousin Henry</span> (1879),</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='sc'>Doctor Wortle's School</span> (1881),</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span><span class='sc'>The Fixed Period</span> (1882),</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='sc'>Kept in the Dark</span> (1882),</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='sc'>An Old Man's Love</span> (1884).</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>It so happened that <cite>An Eye for An Eye</cite> was written
before the publication of <cite>The Way We Live Now</cite>,
although not published until some while after. It is,
however, clearly the product (if an unconscious one) of
the same impulse as gave birth to the other books, and
its theme—the struggle in the mind of a young Englishman
between pride of family and desire to fulfil a marriage
promise to a girl who has become his mistress—is
a theme of the type peculiar to these six brief stories
and distinctly foreign to Trollope's more bulky and
eventful work.</p>

<p class='c000'>A further group of five stories may roughly be termed
Trollope's “oversea” novels. The first three—<cite>Nina
Balatka</cite> (1867), <cite>Linda Tressel</cite> (1868), and <cite>The Golden
Lion of Granpere</cite> (1872)—were written more or less
intentionally to form a distinct trio. They are semi-romantic
tales, staged respectively in old Prague, in old
Nürnberg, and among the Vosges mountains; pleasant
enough, but quite definitely of minor importance. The
first two were published anonymously but achieved
little success, and were later reissued over the author's
name. <cite>Harry Heathcote of Gangoil</cite> (1874) and <cite>John
Caldigate</cite> (1879) are novels of Australia, based on the
knowledge of that continent which the author gained
when visiting one of his sons who had established himself
there. I understand that as pictures of Australian
life they are vivid and reliable. Be that as it may, the
untutored reader, seeking only for Trollope, will find
him abundantly in <cite>Harry Heathcote</cite>, which is an
eventful, almost an adventurous story, and to a very
satisfying degree in the longer book that appeared five
years later.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of Trollope's various volumes of short stories nothing
need here be said. Of <cite>Sir Harry Hotspur of Humblethwaite</cite>
(1871) there is little that can be said. Of <cite>The
Struggles of Brown, Jones, and Robinson</cite> (1870) there
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>is much that had better be left unsaid. One important
full-length novel remains, good in itself and at the same
time remarkable as the only one of the author's tales in
which he arms himself formally as a social crusader.</p>

<p class='c000'><cite>The Vicar of Bullhampton</cite> (1870) is a novel written in
defence of the “fallen woman.” It is quaint to read
Trollope's solemn and tactful preface, in which he
almost apologizes to his public for venturing on such
indelicate ground. Fortunately the book is so feeble as
propaganda that, but for the preface, one would be
unaware that it was written with any special purpose.
It can be enjoyed as a good story of village life, with a
delightful parson as central figure and the necessary
complement of charming Trollope ladies, gruff farmers,
lonely landowners, and aggressive Nonconformity.</p>

<p class='c000'>This novel, like all Trollope's really good work, impresses
the reader first and foremost with its Englishry.
Perhaps it would not be too much to say that the very
greatness of the author himself springs from this same
quality. He is intensely English, with the quiet
humour, the shy sympathy masquerading as indifference,
the delicate sense of kindliness and toleration,
the occasional heaviness, the occasional irritability, that
mark a man or a book as English. But if to these
qualities he owes his place in our proud heritage of
literature, to them also he owes the tarrying of due recognition,
for they and the natures that possess them are
of all qualities and of all natures the most difficult to
impress upon the sceptical outsider, seeing that their
very beauty and preciousness and power lie in their
elusiveness.</p>

London: John Lane, 1913.</p>

<p class='c000'>This book will be of interest to the general reader,
although it is rather overloaded with analyses of novel-plots
and the arrangement is not ideal.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>By far the most valuable feature of the volume is the
bibliography of Trollope by Margaret Lavington included
at the end. For the help this careful and
documented compilation has given me I wish to make
acknowledgment, although I have throughout worked
independently and from original sources and taken none
of the facts hereafter given without verification. Miss
Lavington's descriptions lack certain details essential to
the collector, she makes one or two actual mistakes, but,
within the limits she has laid down for herself, her work
is wonderfully complete and accurate.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Notes</span>—(i) This book was published in March, 1865.</p>

<p class='c009'>(ii) A binding of dark green cloth is more frequently seen than
that of maroon, but it is fairly certain that the latter is really the
first issue. I have come to this conclusion after a study of other
publications, for binding which the two types of cloth used for <cite>Miss
Mackenzie</cite> were employed. Both are patterned cloths, but differently
patterned. That used in maroon for <cite>Miss Mackenzie</cite> was also
used—differently coloured, of course—for Trollope's <cite>Tales of All
Countries</cite> (1861); Ainsworth's <cite>Constable of the Tower</cite> (1861);
Mrs. Gaskell's <cite>Round the Sofa</cite> (1859) and <cite>Right at Last</cite> (1860);
Charles Allston Collins' <cite>Cruise Upon Wheels</cite> (1862); and Reade's
<cite>Love me Little, Love me Long</cite> (1859). The pattern of cloth, on the
other hand, used in dark green for <cite>Miss Mackenzie</cite> reappears on
Trollope's <cite>Belton Estate</cite> (1866); Ainsworth's <cite>John Law</cite> (1864); and
Wilkie Collins' <cite>My Miscellanies</cite> (1863). I think these facts provide
sufficiently conclusive evidence that the maroon cloth is of an earlier
pattern than the dark green. Publishers were probably inclined,
then as now, to use one type of cloth more than another at certain
given dates (possibly they tended to adopt novelties as produced by
their binders). This is independently suggested by the fact that in
the year 1863 alone an identical pattern of cloth was used and by
various publishers for Ainsworth's <cite>Cardinal Pole</cite>, for Mrs. Gaskell's
<cite>A Dark Night's Work</cite>, for George Eliot's <cite>Romola</cite>, and for Mrs.
Oliphant's <cite>Perpetual Curate</cite>.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Notes</span>—(i) Four weeks after the appearance of Part I. (early in
November, 1869) a parallel series of two-shilling <em>monthly</em> parts was
inaugurated, of which the first, containing the first four weekly
parts, was immediately issued, and the remainder at regular
intervals. The earliest part issue was therefore the weekly one.
Margaret Lavington in her Trollope bibliography, states that the
first four parts were wrappered in one. This observation was
probably made from an examination of a made-up set of parts
composed, as to the first four, of the second issue and, as to the
remainder, of the first (see above).</p>

stitched in at the end of the numbers of the magazine
with their own pagination. The series contained
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>eleven full-page line-engraved illustrations by F. A.

I have failed to establish the exact publishing date of the one-volume

enough the later issue is rarer than the earlier, for the sheets were
quickly taken over by Routledge and issued in a different binding
in 1872.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is evident, from a comparison between the foregoing details and
the collation of the four-volume edition previously described, that
the publishers were compelled, to complete the latter, to print a
contents list to Vol. 1. and to add the words “In four volumes,
Vol. 1.,” etc., to the title-pages. It will be seen that they had so
mismanaged the pagination of the preliminary matter during part
issue, that only one of the four final volumes was correctly paged
throughout.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Notes</span>—(i) This book was published in November, 1868. The
contents had appeared in “St. Paul's Magazine.”</p>

<p class='c009'>(ii) The sheets of the first edition were later issued without change
of date in a slightly different green binding, without the title in gold
on the side, and bearing as imprint on spine, Daldy, Isbister and Co.
The reissue was cut down to cr. 8vo, and the end-papers were
chocolate instead of yellow.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>(iii) A still later issue of the book in its reduced format was
bound in bright blue cloth, blocked in gold and black. This binding
bears no imprint on spine, and was probably carried out by
W. H. Smith and Son for a balance of edition purchased by them.
George Eliot's novel <cite>Felix Holt</cite> was treated in this way by Smiths
some twelve years after publication, and the binding is very similar
to that now under consideration.</p>

<h3 class='c015'><i>NOTE</i></h3>

<p class='c020'>It is stated by Margaret Lavington in her appendix to
Escott's book that Trollope “printed but never published”
several of his lectures. I have been unable to
trace any privately printed lectures, but feel sure that
Trollope's first bibliographer would not speak of them
as she does without certain knowledge of their existence.

<p class='c000'>From the same source I borrow a statement that a
study of Thackeray by Trollope, originally printed in
the “Cornhill,” was republished as part of Theodore
Taylor's book <cite>Thackeray: The Humourist and Man of
Letters</cite>, which was issued in 1864. It is noticeable that
Margaret Lavington speaks of the publisher of this book
as Appleton of New York. A book of the same title by
the same author was issued in the same year by Hotten
of Piccadilly, and it is a fair presumption that the
volumes are identical, but, although I have been carefully
through the volume issued by Hotten, I cannot identify
any section as contributed by Trollope.</p>

    <div>FREDERICK MARRYAT</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>
<p class='c012'>The reputation of Captain Marryat has suffered at the
hands of time somewhat differently from that of many
of his contemporaries. Superficially he has fared better
than they, for, if little read except by boys, he is at least
acknowledged as a classic, and there are few adult novel
readers who could not from their own childhood gather
sufficient memories to characterize in summary some of
his best known books.</p>

<p class='c000'>Nevertheless, it is arguable that the forgotten author
is happier than he who is accepted but unread. A
revival of interest in the books of a man not already
docketed and filed in the appreciation of his age may
develop a new perspective. The body of his work may
be exhumed and permanently lodged in its proper niche
of the catacombs of literature. More hardly shall this
befall such a one as Marryat, who is “placed” already
as a writer of sea stories for boys and as an instructor
in adventure for young people.</p>

<p class='c000'>Who shall deny that he is all of this? His fame as
a novelist of naval escapade, of risk and makeshift
among pirates and barbarians, is fame deserved. The
difficulty for one concerned to reappraise his work lies in
the fact that there is more to him than is here implied.
He is the only writer in the tradition of Fielding and
Smollett who can claim consideration on the same plane
as these famous authors. That he is overtopped by <cite>Tom
Jones</cite> no one will dispute, but that he ranks with and not
after Smollett is a contention that permits of argument.</p>

<p class='c000'>The first result of an attempt to classify the books of
Captain Marryat is a realization that two of his finest
works are—the one wholly, the other mainly—unconcerned
with ships or seafarers. <cite>Japhet in Search of a
Father</cite> (1836) is a picturesque tale of vagabondage and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>social escapade. <cite>The Pacha of Many Tales</cite> (1835) is an
adaptation of “The Arabian Nights,” a series of narratives
held together by a framework of Oriental despotism.</p>

<p class='c000'><cite>Japhet</cite> is partnered by two later novels—<cite>Joseph Rushbrook;
or, The Poacher</cite> (1841) and <cite>Valerie</cite> (1849). All
three are land as opposed to sea novels, and the first two
show the fertile invention of the author, his power of
describing rogues and fashionable grotesques. But
whereas <cite>Japhet</cite> is the best book Marryat ever wrote, <cite>The
Poacher</cite> is a little weary, for it dates from the last period
of the writer's life, when ill-health and money troubles
were pressing hardly on a man already exhausted by a
reckless youth; while <cite>Valerie</cite>, the autobiography of a
French girl cast on her own resources in Paris and in
London, had better have been left, as Marryat left it, a
fragment cut short by sickness and by death.</p>

<p class='c000'><cite>The Pacha of Many Tales</cite> stands quite alone and
stands proudly. Marryat's humour is in this book congenial
to the modern reader, while of fantastic happening
few works of fiction can show so rich a store. It is
hard to understand why this admirable parody of the
“Thousand and One Nights” is to-day so little read.
Perhaps some enterprising publisher will extract the
story of Huckaback and issue it, grotesquely illustrated.
It should find its market.</p>

<p class='c000'>The sea stories proper need little comment. They are
eleven in number:</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>The first of these titles is pure autobiography and, as
the author himself admitted, lacks most of the essentials
of fiction. The story is of the slightest and most perfunctory,
the book being little more than an account of
Marryat's own early adventures at sea. David Hannay,
in his excellent little <cite>Life of Marryat</cite>, remarks acutely
on the peculiar meanness of the hero's character—a
meanness that makes an even more repellant appearance
in the last but one of the sea stories—<cite>Percival Keene</cite>.
Seeing that Marryat was writing of himself and that the
events in the life of Frank Mildmay must have been
easily recognizable by naval contemporaries, it is remarkable
that he should present his central figure so unsympathetically,
<em>unless he failed to realize the young man's
shortcomings</em>. Perhaps in part he saw his mistake, for
in the five novels that followed <cite>The Naval Officer</cite> he
offers the reader more respectable but more colourless
heroes. When the time came for writing <cite>Percival
Keene</cite>, either he had forgotten the warnings of twelve
years before or else he was tired of erecting dummy
humanity to placate the idealism of his readers.</p>

<p class='c000'>The constructional weakness of <cite>The Naval Officer</cite>
Marryat took pains to correct in his succeeding books.
<cite>Peter Simple</cite>, <cite>Jacob Faithful</cite> and the rest may depend
for their vitality and attraction on the excitements
encountered by their heroes while voyaging the seas or
fighting in the wars. Certainly the by-plots are unimportant
and conventional. But the author was careful
in them all to give to the <em>course</em> of the heroes' adventures
a real prominence and coherence, so that we read with
an anxiety to know what happens next and are not, as in
<cite>The Naval Officer</cite>, continually brought up by naval
“shop” or invited to feel indignant sympathy with the
members of a noble but scurvily treated service.</p>

<p class='c000'><cite>The Pirate</cite> and <cite>The Privateer's-Man</cite> are exciting tales
of ocean brigandage, the latter having in addition an
antiquarian interest, for the first portion of the story is
based on the actual life-record of an old time sea-rover.
<cite>Poor Jack</cite>, although told in the first person and comprising
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>scenes on shipboard and adventurous happenings at
sea of a kind to suggest comparison with <cite>Mr. Midshipman
Easy</cite>, has an historical interest apart from its
value as fiction, because it is an account of Greenwich
Hospital, in those days a retreat for wounded seamen.</p>

<p class='c000'>Two groups remain among the stories of Frederick
Marryat. <cite>Snarleyow</cite> (1837) and <cite>The Phantom Ship</cite>
(1839) stand definitely apart from the rest of the novels.
Both tell of Dutch seafaring in the old days and both
introduce a strong element of the weird and the mysterious.
That Marryat should in these books have come
under the influence of the “terror” motive in fiction is
surprising and interesting. After reading <cite>Japhet</cite> or
<cite>Mr. Midshipman Easy</cite> one would declare that nothing
was farther from the talent of their author than an excursion
into the “horrid.” And yet both <cite>Snarleyow</cite> and
<cite>The Phantom Ship</cite> are excellent books, which rank high
among Marryat's novels for liveliness and for characterization
and, in addition, merit notice for their fearsomeness.
Of their value as historical documents I am
unqualified to speak, but it may be presumed that before
writing them the author studied the lives and methods
of seventeenth and eighteenth century Dutch mariners,
for both books are circumstantially staged and show no
desire to shirk description of contemporary fact.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of the stories written definitely for children the best
known (and rightly) is <cite>Masterman Ready</cite> (1841-1842).
It was followed by <cite>The Travels and Adventures of
Monsieur Violet</cite> (1843); <cite>The Settlers in Canada</cite> (1844);
<cite>The Mission; or, Scenes in Africa</cite> (1845); <cite>The Children
of the New Forest</cite> (1847); and <cite>The Little Savage</cite>
(1848-1849).</p>

<p class='c000'><cite>Monsieur Violet</cite> is an improbable and tedious tale of
Red Indians and Mormons. The rest—with the exception
of <cite>The Children of the New Forest</cite>, which is a story
of Cavaliers and Roundheads—tell in one form or another
the eternal tale of young adventurers in wild countries.</p>

<p class='c000'>Marryat loved children and knew how to tell stories
that they could like and understand. This to-day is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>undisputed. But that he is equally a novelist for the
critical sorely needs reaffirmation. His juvenile public
has been more faithful to him than that of maturer years,
and one can only hope that time will restore him to the
affection of the adult. <cite>Masterman Ready</cite> is as fresh
to-day as when, eighty years ago, it first appeared; but
the freshness is due as much to Marryat as to his youthful
admirers, and that same freshness is no less present
in the best of his other books than it is in this children's
classic. Let the modern novel reader have no fear. In
taking up <cite>Japhet</cite>, or <cite>Peter Simple</cite>, or <cite>A Pacha of Many
Tales</cite>, he will take up a fine book and good literature,
and not merely a poker with which to rake among the
ashes of his own vanished childhood.</p>

<p class='c020'>Two books have appeared dealing with the life and

By <span class='sc'>Florence Marryat</span>. 2 vols. London: Bentley,
1872.</p>

<p class='c018'>Like so many loyal and affectionate biographers,
Mrs. Ross Church is too casual a user of dates and
too summary an adherent to chronology to allow to
her book great reference value.</p>

Hannay</span>. London: Walter Scott. 1889.</p>

<p class='c018'>This is an admirable little book so far as the main
text is concerned. Its bibliography, however, although
valuable for the list given of biographical
and critical articles devoted to Marryat, as well as
for facts regarding subsequent editions of Marryat's
works, is very unreliable as an authority on first
editions.</p>

(5⅞ × 9⅛). Pp. (viii) + 315 + (1). The book contains
twenty full-page illustrations in steel engraving, of
which two—an engraved portrait frontispiece and
picture title-page—precede printed title. Cream
paper boards, gilt, lettered on spine in gold <span class='sc'>The
Pirate by Capt<sup>n.</sup> Marryat</span>. Yellow end-papers.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Notes</span>—(i) Although dated 1836, this book was actually published
in December, 1835.</p>

<p class='c009'>(ii) Copies are more frequently met with in maroon cloth, blocked
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>in gold and lettered on spine <span class='sc'>Marryats Pirate and the Three
Cutters</span>. This cloth binding (of which two styles at least are
extant) is probably not so early in date as the paper-board binding
described above. Definite information is impossible to obtain, but
the evidence of similar illustrated books of the period (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">e.g.</span></i>, Lytton's
<cite>Pilgrims of the Rhine</cite>) supports the theory here laid down.</p>

<p class='c009'>(iii) A large paper edition, imperial 8vo (11 × 7½), was issued
simultaneously, with plates printed on India paper and bound in
green paper boards, half dark-green figured cloth, cream paper
label, the last being lettered in gold: <span class='sc'>The Pirate by Capt<sup>n.</sup>
Marryat</span>. White end-papers. Copies of the large paper edition
also exist in maroon cloth, blocked in gold and blind and lettered
on the spine: <span class='sc'>Marryats Pirate and the Three Cutters</span>. As
with the ordinary edition, these full cloth copies are of later issue
than those in boards.</p>

<p class='c009'>(iv) In all Longman's first editions the plates bear the following
legend: 'Published Dec<sup>r</sup>. 1, 1835 for the proprietor by Longman
and Co., Paternoster Row.' The book was, however, never
issued with a <em>printed</em> title of that year. That the actual plates
were published prior to the Longman book edition is proved by
the fact that I have myself a set, both before and after “letters,”
bearing the legend: 'London. Published Oct<sup>r</sup>. 1835 for the proprietor
by Charles Tilt, 86 Fleet Street.' In every other respect,
even down to the page references, the wording on these early dated
plates is identical with that used for Longman's book edition.</p>

<p class='c009'>(v) A curious feature of this book's publishing history is its issue
in parts, nine years after its appearance in book form. In 1845
there appeared over the imprint A. Fullarton and Co., 106 Newgate
Street, London; 67 Abbey street, Dublin; Steads Place, Leith
Walk, and 5 Nicholson Street, Edinburgh, fifteen shilling parts
(6 × 9½), bound in buff paper wrappers printed in red-brown, and
illustrated with steel engravings after Clarkson Stanfield. These
engravings are twenty in number and identical with those in the
first book edition, except that the Longmans imprint has been
substituted on the plates by that of Fullarton, and the printer's
name and the date of issue have been expunged. The distribution
of plates among the fifteen parts is as follows: Parts I. IV. VI.
VIII. X. contain two plates each; Parts II. III. V. VII. IX.
XI. XII. XIII. XIV. and XV. contain one plate each. Publishers'
advertisements occupy outside back wrappers. No date
appears on the parts, but a title-page (with other preliminary
matter) enclosed in Part XV. is dated <span class='fss'>MDCCCXLV</span>.</p>

<p class='c009'>The text of the book was clearly reset for this part issue, so
there can be no question of a refurbishing of Longman sheets.
It may be noted that, according to the wrappers, the plates were
“engraved under the superintendence of Mr. Charles Heath.”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>(This person was responsible for the principal Books of Beauty,
Keepsakes, and similar gift publications issued in large numbers
toward Christmas time between 1840 and 1850 and distinguished
by their beautiful steel engravings.)</p>

<p class='c009'>There being no indication that the plates were re-engraved for
the Fullarton edition, it may be presumed either that Heath superintended
their original production in 1835 but had not at that time
the “selling name” that by 1845 was his, or that Fullarton,
anxious to give to their reissue something of novelty, paid Heath
for a supervisory activity of a nominal kind in order to have the
use of his name on their wrappers.</p>

Longman, Orme, Brown, Green and Longmans,
Paternoster Row. 1840. 1 vol. Large Med. 8vo

of bound-up parts, the half-title is p. 1 of the
story itself and does not precede frontispiece. The
book contains forty-seven wood engravings after
Clarkson Stanfield, of which thirty-six printed
separately and eleven in the text. Dark green cloth,
blocked in gold. Yellow end-papers.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Notes</span>—(i) This book was published on December 1, 1840.</p>

<p class='c009'>(ii) <cite>Poor Jack</cite> first appeared in twelve monthly shilling parts
(5⅞ × 9), bound in buff paper wrappers, printed in black. The first
was published at the beginning of January, and the last at the
beginning of December, 1840. Each part (subject to the variations
stated below) contained three full-page wood engravings after
Clarkson Stanfield, printed separately. Eleven small engravings
appear throughout the text.</p>

<p class='c009'>Included in Part XII. were title-page and preliminary matter
(x pp.).</p>

<p class='c009'>Parts I. to III. were undated; Part IV. was dated April 1; and
each succeeding part was dated similarly with the month of its
appearance.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>Part I. should contain at front or back publishers' catalogue,
8 pp., dated January 1, 1840, and entitled “Poor Jack's Advertising

<p class='c009'>Part II. should contain at front publishers' 4 pp. list, dated
February, 1840, and a prospectus (8 pp., enclosed in buff wrappers)
of McCulloch's Geographical, Statistical and Historical Dictionary.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>(i) No plates were issued with Part IX., but six instead of three
with Part X. A slip should be found inserted in Part IX. calling
attention to the arrangement. My own set shows a similar
happening in the case of Parts VII. and VIII., but there is no sign
of a slip having figured in the former to explain the absence of
illustration.</p>

<p class='c009'>(ii) In two cases there are variations in underline between part
and book issue: (<em>a</em>) One of the plates included in Part XI. is
entitled “The Euphrosyne in the Downs,” but this legend is
omitted altogether in some copies of the book. (<em>b</em>) Included in
Part XII. is a plate entitled “The Prize at Sheerness.” This
underline reads in most copies of the book “The Prize in The
Medway.” Collectors anxious to possess the actual first issue of
the book—<em>i.e.</em>, that bound up from actual parts—should examine
these two points in copies they consider purchasing.</p>

<p class='c016'>THE FLORAL TELEGRAPH: A New Mode of
Communication by floral signals. With Plates.

<span class='fss'>MDCCCXXXVI</span>. 1 vol. Fcap. 8vo (4¼ × 6¾). Pp. xv +
(i) + 307 + (11). Publishers' advertisements occupy

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Notes</span>—(i) This book was published in December, 1836. It was
reissued, probably in 1850, with a cancel title-page reading: “The
Floral Telegraph or Affection's Signals” by the late Captain
Marryatt [<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">sic</span></i>] R.N., author of <cite>Peter Simple</cite> etc. London:
Saunders and Otley, Conduit Street. The pagination reads: xv +
(i) + 324. Pp. xv + (i) + 189 + (1) are identical in the two editions,
which are probably to this point composed of the same sheets.
The second half of the book has, however, been reset, altered, and
extended. The illustrations are the same as in the earlier edition,
but they are much more coarsely reproduced and mechanically
coloured. Olive-green cloth, similar to the first edition, but
differently blocked in gold. Yellow end-papers.</p>

<p class='c009'>(ii) It is a moot point whether or not Marryat was the author of
this rather foolish little book. That he had, however, definite
connection with it is suggested by the fact that on its first
publication the “Metropolitan Magazine,” at that time closely
identified with Marryat, devoted to it a three-quarter-page highly
laudatory review, of which, after praising the introduction, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>writer said: “Though no name is found on the title-page, it is
evident that the work is from a practised and popular writer.”
Further, if Marryat were not the author, it is difficult to understand
the publishers' motive in reissuing it immediately after his death
with his name on the title-page. If he deserves responsibility for
the book, the manœuvre is comprehensible enough, especially on
the part of a firm with whom he had severed relations in 1837,
and thus deprived them of the profitable exploitation of his established
reputation.</p>

  <h3 class='c015'><i>NOTE</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c020'>The six items that follow are, like <cite>Rattlin the Reefer</cite>,
the work of Lieut. the Hon. Edward Granville George
Howard, who worked as sub-editor to Marryat on the
“Metropolitan Magazine.” At one time the actual
authorship of Howard's books was ascribed to Marryat
himself. This is now proved to be a mistake. Indeed,
apart from the note of recommendation to <cite>Rattlin the
Reefer</cite> and Marryat's review of that book in his magazine,
there is no printed evidence that he had any share
whatever in the composition of any one of them. On
the other hand, he and Howard were very intimate; the
stories of the latter are clearly influenced by the work of
his chief; and Marryat collectors have been in the habit
of regarding Howard's books as desirable adjuncts to a
Marryat collection. For which reasons, and because it
is no less probable than improbable that Marryat, in
conversation if not by actual pencraft, helped to give his
sub-editor's books their final shape, I have thought well
to include them in this bibliography.</p>

<p class='c020'>It is well known that Captain Marryat was a painter
as well as a writer. Collectors of his written work will
perhaps also be interested to know of a published book
containing in reproduction some of his drawings. In
1825 or 1826 there appeared the following work:</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>ILLUSTRATIONS OF THE BURMESE WAR.

Published by Thomas Clay. (N.D.) The volume
measures 20½ × 13¼, is bound in thick grey paper
wrappers lettered in black as above, and contains
five engravings of pictures painted by Stothard and
D. Cox after drawings by Captain Marryat. The
name Kingsbury and Co., 6 Leadenhall Street,
appears at the foot of the engravings as their publisher,

  </div>
</div>

</div>
<p class='c012'>It is easier to blame historians and political critics of the
life and statesmanship of Disraeli for neglecting his
novels, than it is oneself to judge these novels as literature,
apart from the huge mass of incident, ambition, and
achievement that went to make up the character of their
extraordinary author. To attempt in a few pages an
estimate of Disraeli as a man of letters were manifestly
absurd, seeing that he was rarely that and nothing else.
It were doubly absurd, even if possible, to treat in summary
of the interactions of his political and literary
genius when one of the finest biographies of modern
times (and that in six volumes) has already covered every
inch of the ground. The only purpose, therefore, which
these unauthoritative notes may serve is that of indicating
in a few words the development of Disraeli as a
novelist and the respective content of his principal books.</p>

<p class='c000'>Although his novels fall into distinct and different
groups, they are all primarily satirical in character.
From the moment of the anonymous but sensational
appearance of <cite>Vivian Grey</cite> to that of the publication of
<cite>Endymion</cite> which bore on each of its three volumes the
name of the most distinguished statesman of the world,
Disraeli held up alike to the follies and the ideals of his
age the mirror of a keen and ruthless mind.</p>

<p class='c000'>But if he gazed on his contemporaries more often from
the angle of satire than from any other, he enclosed in
their various frames the period portraits that are his
books. As a very young man—unknown, ambitious, at
once receptive and intensely sensitive—he used as material
for fiction not only the incidents of his own life, but,
even more, the thoughts and aspirations that filled his
teeming brain. <cite>Vivian Grey</cite> (1826-7), <cite>Contarini Fleming</cite>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>(1833), and <cite>Alroy</cite> (1833) are mainly interesting as autobiography,
and to the use of personal experience as
material for novel-writing he returned in extreme old
age when, looking back from the splendid eminence of
his power, he described in the pages of <cite>Endymion</cite> the
long road that he had travelled from obscurity to fame.</p>

<p class='c000'><cite>Vivian Grey</cite> appeared in five volumes, with an interval
of a year between the issue of the first two and that
of the last three. But for the brilliant publicity given
to it by Colburn, the book would have attracted little or
no attention. It is a showy, careless pastiche of the
society of the day, a gallery of isolated portraits rather
than a single composition, attractive to the fashionable
public of the time for its thinly veiled presentment of
well-known men and women. The reader is further
unpleasantly aware that the author's interest in his book
did not extend much beyond the first of the five volumes.
Young men find it easier to start a book than to finish
one, and Disraeli was clearly no exception to the rule.</p>

<p class='c000'><cite>Contarini Fleming</cite> and <cite>Alroy</cite>, written after an extended
tour in the East, show, at its most luxuriant and
ornate, the author's talent for heady, rhetorical prose.
Like most of his race, Disraeli was more susceptible to
magnificence and to decoration than to severe simplicity,
and throughout his books was prone to an excessive use
of epithet and metaphor. If these two early books show
his love of ornament more shamelessly than those
written at a maturer age, they can claim nevertheless to
have received more careful and conscientious working,
so that their embellishments, if too lavish, are at least
scrupulously fashioned.</p>

<p class='c000'>Between the publication of the last three volumes of
<cite>Vivian Grey</cite> and that of the story of <cite>Contarini Fleming</cite>
Disraeli published two works of fiction which, although
in the matter of primary characteristic isolated from the
rest of his work and from each other, contain elements
that constantly reappear in the books of his later life.</p>

<p class='c000'><cite>The Voyage of Captain Popanilla</cite> (1828) is a satire on
English political and social institutions cast in the form
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>of an inverted <cite>Gulliver's Travels</cite> or <cite>Erewhon</cite>. Instead
of an Englishman reaching an imaginary and fantastic
land, where he finds conditions that correspond partly
to the prejudices, partly to the ideals, of the author, the
hero of Disraeli's satire is a being from a mythical world,
who comes over the sea to an island that is, in all but
name, England as Disraeli saw it. As an example of
pertinacious and aggressive parody <cite>The Voyage of
Captain Popanilla</cite> is witty and readable enough, but it
fatigues, as do all pastiches of the kind, by its somewhat
literal pursuit of contemporary activity. Disraeli should
have limited his prospect of satire, for the individual
beauties of any view are appreciated in proportion to the
smallness of their number. <cite>Popanilla</cite> is overcrowded,
and the reader's mind tires with the effort to solve the
riddle that is contained in nearly every paragraph.</p>

<p class='c000'><cite>The Young Duke</cite> (1831) was written to make money.
One may go farther and confess that the author, seeking
frankly to profit by the contemporary popularity of the
novel of fashionable life, wrote a tale of society into
which he crammed all that he knew of character and
incident likely to appeal to the mood of the moment.
With such antecedents it is surprising that <cite>The Young
Duke</cite> is not a worse book than it is. Inevitably it reads
artificially, and the young writer had not the skill entirely
to conceal the wilfulness with which the work was
put together. On the other hand, the heroine deserves
the attention of Disraeli students, for she is the direct
forerunner of Sybil, and that part of <cite>The Young Duke</cite>
which depends on her personality is not without a touch
of the four great political novels upon which Disraeli's
fame as a writer must rest.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was four years after the publication of <cite>Alroy</cite> that
Disraeli next appeared as a novelist. He then published,
within six months of one another, two stories that stand
markedly apart from the rest of his work, in that they
are wholly without political significance. Even amid
the extravagance of <cite>Contarini Fleming</cite> and <cite>The Young
Duke</cite> occur passages that depend for their significance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>on political movements or political thought of the time.
<cite>Vivian Grey</cite>, being a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">roman à clef</span></i> of high society, and
<cite>Popanilla</cite> being a direct satire of institutions, are
naturally full of what was, even in those days, the
author's ruling interest. But <cite>Henrietta Temple</cite> (1837)
and <cite>Venetia</cite> (1837) are romances pure and simple. They
may be said also to have no autobiographical significance,
save in so far as the first part of the earlier book
was written under the stimulus of a real love affair. It
must be admitted that <cite>Henrietta Temple</cite>, once it gets
beyond the boundary of Disraeli's own passionate experience,
is a tame and careless book. The interval
that passed between the writing of the earlier and that
of the later portion seems to have extinguished his
enthusiasm for the work. Colburn was clamouring for
a novel, and Disraeli, as always hard pressed for money,
raked out his incomplete manuscript, furbished it up,
finished it off, and delivered it to the publisher. <cite>Venetia</cite>
has not this fault of interrupted fashioning. It is, however,
in one reader's opinion at any rate, a very tedious
affair—rhetorical, unreal, and sluggish in movement;
but this view is contrary to that held by many, who consider
that the book's portraiture gives it value as commentary
on the life of Byron and other famous people.</p>

<p class='c000'>There follows, this time after an interval of seven
years, the first of the four famous political novels that,
whether or no they can be said to have introduced a new
genre into English fiction, are undoubtedly the finest
achievements of Disraeli's literary career. <cite>Coningsby</cite>
(1844), <cite>Sybil</cite> (1845), and <cite>Tancred</cite> (1847) are too well
known to need description here. Because, however,
their interdependence as parts of a general scheme in
the mind of the author tends to become obscured by consideration
of their respective quality, note may be taken
of the fact that <cite>Coningsby</cite> is a novel of political views,
<cite>Sybil</cite> one of social conditions and classes among the
people, and <cite>Tancred</cite> one of religion as an influence in
national life. Of the characters in <cite>Coningsby</cite> many
reappear in <cite>Tancred</cite>, while Tadpole and Taper, whose
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>names have become part of English political slang, pull
their wires and cadge their jobs as assiduously in <cite>Sybil</cite>
as in the story that preceded it. It would be interesting to
work out a comparison between Disraeli and Trollope
as political novelists. Probably one would come to the
decision that those of Disraeli are the better political
novels and those of Trollope the better novels of politics.
In other words, Disraeli is the cleverer publicist, but
Trollope the finer artist. <cite>Coningsby</cite> and its fellows
depend very much on contemporary fact and personality
for their full understanding and significance. Surely it
is not hyperæsthetic to demand that literature be its own
interpreter? In so far as a work of art requires outside
knowledge for its proper appreciation, to that extent it
falls short from what in art is highest and most perfect.</p>

<p class='c000'>The appearance of <cite>Lothair</cite> in 1870 caused something
of a scandal in serious political circles. The Briton is
accustomed to take his statesmen seriously, but his
novelists with frivolity and in the leisure hour. Wherefore
he regarded it as unseemly that the name of an
ex-Prime Minister and of a man whose political career
was by no means run should figure on the title-pages of
a three-volume novel. Curiosity conquered disapproval
and, as on an hundred other occasions, a book condemned
for its very existence was purchased and read in
tens of thousands. <cite>Lothair</cite> is the work of a man who
knew everybody and almost everything. The personal
satire, the constructive and destructive fervour of
<cite>Coningsby</cite>, <cite>Sybil</cite>, and <cite>Tancred</cite> have given place to a
greater gravity and restraint, to an ironic vision more
general and less individual. Taking as his subject the
power of the Catholic Church, the rival power of revolutionary
free thought and the indeterminate central position
of the Church of England, Disraeli built up his
fourth and most extensive picture of the England of his
time. If we miss the idealist conviction that gives to
some of the passages in <cite>Tancred</cite> the force of a splendid
sermon, we gain a certainty and a dignity of thought
which were inevitably lacking in the books of the earlier
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>period. We also continue to enjoy the epigram, the
vivid minor portraiture, the lightning grasp of fact and
of every implication of fact, that give to the political
novels of Disraeli their unique flavour and importance.</p>

exact relationship of the English book to the American original is
not clear; but the former seems also to have been written by an
American, and the original MS., which has been preserved, shows
that Disraeli's share in it was limited to the introduction here
and there of a word or phrase where the excision of a passage rendered
such amendment necessary.” In addition to the corrections
thus described Disraeli contributed an anonymous preface to the
book.</p>

was asked to write a life of Paul Jones. He was interested in the

reads:</p>

<p class='c008'>THE STAR CHAMBER. Vol. I. Part 1. April 19
to June 7, 1826. (Quotation from Cavendish,
“Wolsey.”) London: William Marsh, 145 Oxford
Street. Pp. (iii) and (iv) are occupied by contents
list.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Notes</span>—(i) At one time the responsibility for the whole contents
as well as for the editorship of the “Star Chamber” was fathered
upon Disraeli. Monypenny, however, combats this theory. He
says: “The 'Star Chamber' was founded by a certain Peter Hall,
a friend of Meredith's at Brasenose, who, through Meredith, had
become acquainted with Disraeli. Disraeli contributed some
fables with a political application under the title of <cite>The Modern
Aesop</cite>, and perhaps other matter. But in later life he expressly
denied ('The Times,' November 3, 1871; the 'Leisure Hour,'
November 4, 1871) having been editor, if indeed there ever was an
editor.” This represents, of course, the most recent and authoritative
opinion on the matter; but it is interesting, on p. 150 of the
catalogue of the Hope collection of newspapers, etc., in the
Bodleian Library at Oxford (1865), to find reasons given for the
suppression by Disraeli of all copies of the “Star Chamber” upon
which he could lay his hands. The Peter Hall referred to above
was the Reverend Peter Hall, B.A., editor of “The Crypt.”</p>

<p class='c009'>(ii) It is because the “Star Chamber” has come to be looked
upon as a Disraeli item that I have included it here, despite the
fact that in so doing I exceed the limit of these bibliographies,
which take no account of magazine contributions of the authors
concerned.</p>

<p class='c016'>THE WORKS OF ISAAC DISRAELI. Edited with
Introductions by <span class='sc'>Benjamin Disraeli</span>.</p>

<p class='c000'>Disraeli started work on a new edition of his father's
books in 1847, but the actual publication was, for various
reasons, spread over a period of ten years. The following
are the dates and details in outline of the first issues
of the various titles:</p>

<p class='c008'>1849. CURIOSITIES OF LITERATURE. London:
Edward Moxon. 3 vols. Demy 8vo (5½ × 8¾).
Dark green cloth, gilt. Yellow end-papers. Vol. I.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>contains “A View of the Life and Writings” of
Isaac Disraeli written by his son and extending to
over thirty pages.</p>

<p class='c008'>1851. COMMENTARIES ON THE LIFE AND
REIGN OF CHARLES THE FIRST, KING OF
ENGLAND. London: Henry Colburn. 2 vols.
Demy 8vo (5½ × 8¾). Dark green cloth, gilt. Yellow
end-papers. Vol. I. contains a brief preface by
Benjamin Disraeli.</p>

<p class='c008'>1859. THE LITERARY CHARACTER Or <span class='sc'>The
History of Men of Genius</span>; and LITERARY
MISCELLANIES and AN ENQUIRY INTO
THE CHARACTER OF JAMES THE FIRST.

<p class='c008'>1859. THE CALAMITIES AND QUARRELS OF
AUTHORS. 1 Vol. Cr. 8vo.</p>

<p class='c008'>1859. AMENITIES OF LITERATURE. 2 vols.
Cr. 8vo.</p>

<p class='c000'>These last three items were all published in London
by Routledge, Warnes and Routledge, and bound in
dark green cloth, with yellow end-papers. They contain
no prefaces by Benjamin Disraeli, who contented himself
with care for the text of his father's work.</p>

<h3 class='c015'><i>NOTE</i></h3>

<p class='c020'>To a collected edition of his novels issued in 1870
Disraeli wrote an important preface, characterising the
work of his youth from the viewpoint of a man in his
sixties and indicating the considerable revisions carried
out in nearly all the books.</p>

<p class='c000'>No attempt has been made to include in the foregoing
bibliography the reports of and selections from the
speeches of Disraeli, which—not surprisingly—were
issued in large numbers during his later life. Also are
omitted two volumes of his early letters, published after
his death.</p>

    <div>WILKIE COLLINS</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>
<p class='c012'>Few novelists have enjoyed greater glory than did
Wilkie Collins at the height of his fame; to few did loss
of popularity in later years come more bitterly. For
fame at one time undeniably was his. Not only had he
a large and enthusiastic public; not only were his works
translated into half a dozen languages within a month
of their original publication; not only was he pestered
by the editors of two hemispheres for stories and serials;
but also he figured prominently in the professional
literary life of the time, was the intimate friend of
Dickens, and a member of the innermost ring of artistic
and intellectual society. Probably to his intimacy with
the chief literary personalities of his time is due the considerable
survival of his reputation. Despite the fact
that during the last period of his life he suffered severe
eclipse, and although, beyond <cite>The Moonstone</cite> and <cite>The
Woman in White</cite>, none of his books are regularly read
to-day, he is a name more familiar to the world than
Trollope, a name more notably literary than Marryat.
In the sixties, no less than in the nineteen-twenties, to
belong to the writing set was two-thirds of reputation.
There is no log-rolling so expert, no admiration so
mutual as that existing among members of the various
groups that practise the arts. Whence it has come about
that the name of Wilkie Collins—who as an artist may
not be mentioned in the same chapter as Trollope
or Marryat, or even Mrs. Gaskell—is a household word,
while those of his greater fellows sound strangely, as the
notes of some old-fashioned melody.</p>

<p class='c000'>I do not seek to imply that Collins' survival is in no
way due to the quality of his work. He won the admiration
of his own age and may claim that of posterity as
a superb teller of stories and, in his latter days, as a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>pathetic and courageous figure. But apart from his
dexterity in the contriving of plot, apart from a great (if
intermittent) talent for the portrayal of abnormal character,
he is inferior as a painter of life to many writers
of his time whose very existence is nowadays forgotten.</p>

<p class='c000'>And yet he would, perhaps, himself be content to have
it so. That it was the novelist's primary duty to tell a
story was his own creed, and faithfully he abode by it.
He does not reveal to us human nature as does Trollope;
nor, like Disraeli, pique our interest with satiric brilliance
on topics of follies of the day; he has none of
Marryat's gay familiarity with the winds that blow and
the sun that shines on the crossroads of life's pilgrimage;
he has no fund of rough but genial humanity like Reade;
he is not tender like Mrs. Gaskell, nor mystic visionary
like Herman Melville; even Whyte Melville, with his
stilted rhetoric and clumsy <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">naïveté</span>, has at times an attractive
freshness that Collins lacks. But if we rid our
minds of all thought of him as seeking to throw on the
dark places of existence the light of interpretation, looking
to him rather for entertainment and for excitement,
for deft mystery and for extraordinary coincidence, he
will not disappoint us.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of his novels the largest category, and that including
all the books (save perhaps two) that bear re-reading
nowadays, is that of the dramatic and mystery stories.</p>

<p class='c000'>The first to appear was <cite>After Dark</cite>, published in 1856.
To the modern reader, the unmistakable first appearance
of the real Collins in these excellent tales comes with a
pleasurable shock after the mild bohemianism of the
preceding novel, <cite>Hide and Seek</cite>. <cite>After Dark</cite> consists
of six narratives of varying length and subject, ingeniously
woven together into the pattern of a single story.
At their best they are as good as anything the author
ever wrote; even at their worst they are free from the
perfunctory carelessness that mars so much of his later
work.</p>

<p class='c000'><cite>The Dead Secret</cite> (1857) and <cite>The Queen of Hearts</cite>
(1859) show the novelist carrying farther his talent for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>dramatic construction and his experiments in technique.
Both books contain descriptive passages of sombre
power.</p>

<p class='c000'>There follow successively the four best books of Collins'
career. <cite>The Woman in White</cite> (1860), <cite>No Name</cite>
(1862), <cite>Armadale</cite> (1866), and <cite>The Moonstone</cite> (1868) are
story-telling as fine as the nineteenth century can show.
But they make evident that, even at his zenith, Collins
was no reader of other men's hearts. He could fashion
ingenious puppets to his will, entangling them in the
meshes of his intricate and faultlessly constructed plots;
but neither Count Fosco nor Captain Wragge, neither
Miss Gwilt nor Sergeant Cuff, remains with the reader
as a new friend or as a new enemy. Each is remembered,
rather, as a striking and skilfully designed
marionette, jerking through a Collins drama at the
bidding of a delicate mechanism of strings.</p>

<p class='c000'>After <cite>The Moonstone</cite> the decadence began, and, to a
point, accountably enough. In the first place, the
author threw himself into the production of propaganda
fiction, with results (as may be seen) praiseworthy but a
little ridiculous. Secondly, he paid the usual price of
success and began to over-write. Whereas between
1850 and 1868 he published eleven novels and books of
tales, between 1870 and his death in 1889 he published
eighteen, in addition to a mass of short stories for magazines,
plays, and other incidental work. Thirdly—although
not until late in the seventies—his health began
to fail. With reasons as good as these for a falling off
in Collins' work, it were ungracious to inquire whether,
had he eschewed reform, controlled his pen, and retained
his strength and eyesight, his fiction would have
advanced from strength to strength. Perhaps; perhaps
not. Let us return from hypothetical dilemma to
melancholy fact. After <cite>The Moonstone</cite> the decadence
unmistakably began.</p>

<p class='c000'>When next he came before the public with a novel of
plot, and left for a moment the righting of public wrongs,
his offering was mechanical enough. <cite>The Two Destinies</cite>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>(1876) is built on a series of coincidences so incredible,
that even Collins' candid claim to search the very
border-line of impossibility for material of which to make
a story cannot reconcile us to their unlikelihood.</p>

<p class='c000'><cite>The Haunted Hotel</cite> (1879), <cite>Jezebel's Daughter</cite> (1880),
and <cite>I Say No</cite> (1884) mark a slight improvement, and
can be read with pleasure for the unfailing ingenuity of
their design. <cite>The Evil Genius</cite> (1886) is in the nature
of a bad relapse, from which the dramatic tales never
wholly recover, although, of the three remaining, <cite>Little
Novels</cite> (1887) and <cite>The Legacy of Cain</cite> (1889) are not
without flashes of the old skill and invention. <cite>Blind
Love</cite>, finished by Sir Walter Besant and published posthumously,
may perhaps claim immunity from criticism.</p>

<p class='c000'>As a novelist of indignation Collins is pathetic rather
than blameworthy. He had the usual fanaticisms of the
invalid intellectual—hatred of athleticism, of sport, of
legal injustice, of religious intrigue, of social insincerity;
and his propaganda novels give expression to his passionate
dislikes with a petulant but rather impressive
sincerity. Fortunately for the modern reader of books
which by their very nature are now out of date, Collins
did not fail, even in his tilting at windmills, to regulate
his movements with practised skill. Wherefore all but
one of the propaganda novels have well-contrived plots
and continuity of interest, which those will enjoy who
can disentangle the fictional from the instructional in
the stories' purpose. These “indignation novels” are
six in number:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='sc'>Man and Wife</span> (1870),</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='sc'>The New Magdalen</span> (1873),</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='sc'>The Law and the Lady</span> (1875),</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='sc'>The Fallen Leaves</span> (1879),</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='sc'>The Black Robe</span> (1871), and</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='sc'>Heart and Science</span> (1883).</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>That in other books are present elements of reforming
zeal I am aware—for example, the abuse of private
asylums figures in <cite>The Woman in White</cite> and, as mentioned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>below, there is a propaganda aspect to <cite>Basil</cite>; but
the six above named have their origin wholly in the
author's loathing of some injustice or some social evil.</p>

<p class='c000'><cite>Man and Wife</cite> illustrates the cruel working of the
marriage laws of the United Kingdom and, incidentally,
voices the author's conviction that athleticism was at the
time rapidly brutalizing the youth of England. <cite>The
Law and the Lady</cite> ventilates another grievance against
legal injustice in matters sexual. <cite>The New Magdalen</cite>
and <cite>The Fallen Leaves</cite> are protests against the outlawry
of the prostitute and of the girl who gives herself, unhallowed
by the religious rite, to love. It is strange
that, of two books on the same subject, one (<cite>The New
Magdalen</cite>) should be the best novel of its class and not
far below the highest level ever attained by the author,
while the other (<cite>The Fallen Leaves</cite>) should hold the last
place among everything that Collins wrote. <cite>The New
Magdalen</cite> is a moving and dignified treatment of a very
difficult theme; <cite>The Fallen Leaves</cite>, from its aggressive
preface to its sugary, unreal end, is tragic proof that
high motive and technical efficiency may yet come
together and produce only imbecile hysteria.</p>

<p class='c000'><cite>The Black Robe</cite> is anti-Jesuit; <cite>Heart and Science</cite>
anti-vivisection. Both are readable, and the latter something
more. It may be noted that Collins himself called
<cite>Heart and Science</cite> his best novel since <cite>Man and Wife</cite>.
Probably opinion to-day would set it above that humourless
and over-appendixed story, but it must rank below
<cite>The New Magdalen</cite> and, possibly, also below <cite>The
Haunted Hotel</cite>.</p>

<p class='c000'>The novels that remain may hardly be classified.
<cite>Antonina</cite>, the story of Ancient Rome, with which in 1850,
and following a fashion of the day, he began his
novelist's career, is essentially a first book—painstaking,
over-elaborate, and dull.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was succeeded by <cite>Mr. Wray's Cash Box</cite> (1852), a
brief and sentimental tale, mainly interesting for the
evidence it provides of Dickens's influence over the
young Collins at the very beginning of their long friendship.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>Those who enjoy hearty Christmas jollity, lovable
if ludicrous old age, uncouth fidelity, incompetent villainy,
and sweet simple maidenhood will find <cite>Mr. Wray's
Cash Box</cite> pleasant enough.</p>

<p class='c000'><cite>Basil</cite> (1852) and <cite>Hide and Seek</cite> (1854) are novels of
contemporary life, a little sombre, emotionally a little
exaggerated. There is a hint of crusading fervour in
<cite>Basil</cite> (against drunken nurses and hospital routine), but
the motif is not strong enough to class the book as a
propaganda novel. The young author (as many both
before and since have done) found stimulus for these
books in the pathetic figure of the debauched girl; but
she receives at his hands treatment little different from
that usually given her by serious neophytes, eager to
paint her tragic isolation for the improvement of the
novel-reading public.</p>

<p class='c000'>There is in <cite>Hide and Seek</cite> an element of interest apart
from that of the story itself. Much of the action takes
place in a painter's studio, and Collins has full scope
for showing his fondness for art, an enthusiasm suitable
enough in the son and biographer of a distinguished
painter, but somewhat uncommon among novelists of
his age. Throughout his work he makes play with
knowledge of contemporary painting, displaying decided
and on the whole admirable taste, often well in advance
of his time.</p>

<p class='c000'><cite>Poor Miss Finch</cite> (1872) is more a story of contemporary
social life than either a novel of mystery or one of propaganda.
It may therefore appear here as pendant to the
two early books just described. The central figure is a
blind girl. In <cite>Hide and Seek</cite> the author took credit to
himself for introducing a deaf mute, but as the affliction
plays no part in the story one must refrain from joining
in the applause. The blindness of Miss Finch, on the
other hand, is the pivot of her tale, and a very elaborate,
improbable, and overcrowded tale it is. The fact is
regrettable. Neatly contrived, related in a series of
narratives from different sources and from different points
of view, based largely on the antagonism of two brothers,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>and pervaded by the wise spirit of an elderly governess-companion,
this novel is so nearly an epitome of the
methods and tricks of Wilkie Collins, that one could
wish it more thoroughly a success.</p>

<p class='c000'>And here, save for scattered volumes of short stories
and one or two brief and unimportant novels, ends the
tale of Collins's books. He is a writer for tired minds,
capable—thanks to his perfect control of the mechanism
of incident—of holding the interest without calling on the
emotional reserves of his reader. His influence on the
novel of sensation has been enormous. It is the least
of his due that a generation brought up on the mystery
stories of his disciples should find time to turn over the
principal works of the master himself.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Notes</span>—(i) This book was published in September, 1860. The
first one-volume edition (1861, magenta cloth blocked in gold and
blind) contains a special preface.</p>

<p class='c009'>(ii) I am uncertain whether or not the earliest copies of this
novel contained in any one of the three volumes a publishers'
catalogue. The first editions I have seen show a 16 pp. catalogue
at the end of Vol. III., but dated November, 1860, so that they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>belong clearly to a subsequent issue. <cite>The Woman in White</cite> is a
case over which the buyer should take great care. A so-called
“New Edition” was issued in the year of publication and <em>with
binding identical</em> to that of the first edition, for which reason only
the right advertisement matter can show that a copy is untampered
with. I should welcome information tending to establish whether
a catalogue (and if so where and of what date) should properly
figure in a “right” copy of the novel.</p>

<p class='c012'>If no judgment is here attempted of the work of Charles
Reade, it is because he refuses to be “placed,” in the
opinion of the present writer. At times he is so fine, so
resilient, so impressive; at others, the dullest of pamphleteers,
a cramped Meredith in style, a very waxwork
among sensationalists. Fortunately certain aspects of
his powerful but clumsy mind have of late been admirably
presented. The “London Mercury” for June,
1921 (Vol. IV., No. 20), contained an article by E. W.
Hornung which all interested would do well to read. In
the matter of biography proper students may be referred
(but without confidence) to:</p>

<p class='c009'>(ii) The date is purely conjectural. Coleman mentions no play
of this title, but speaks of <cite>Griffith Gaunt</cite> as having been produced
in 1868 or 1869. The above item being a dramatic version of
<cite>Griffith Gaunt</cite>, I am inclined to think that this is the play referred
to, and have accordingly dated it as having been printed about the
time of the first production.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Notes</span>—(i) This play was reissued in 1890 in a pamphlet printed
for private circulation by W. Spearing, 1, Great Queen Street,
W.C. The booklet measures 5½ × 8½; contains pp. 148—of which
(1) to (4) are regular prelims., (5) to (146) are printed alternately
and paged (5) to 76, and (147) and (148) are blank—and is bound in
grey paper wrappers, printed in black. The text of this second
version shows considerable variation from that of the first, and
the play is in four acts instead of five.</p>

<p class='c009'>(ii) The date at the head of this item is conjectural. Reade's
first original dramatization of <cite>It's Never Too Late to Mend</cite> was
written by 1864 and produced in 1865. Coleman speaks in that
year of receiving from Laura Seymour a “yellow covered book”
of the text of the play, and this book, if printed, was the real first
edition. But I cannot prove the existence of a printed text at
that date, and prefer to give first place to the pamphlet here
described, although, because of the other plays mentioned on the
title-page, it cannot be of earlier date than 1872.</p>

<p class='c009'>(iii) In July, 1860, a dramatization of Reade's novel had been
issued in Lacy's Acting Edition. Reade was rightly furious at the
unauthorized issue of this version, and hastened to prepare one
of his own. For the benefit of those interested I append details
of the pirate booklet.</p>

Reade hotly denied that he had read or even heard of this French

enough. He is, however, less certain that Boucicault was not
familiar with the supposed French original. <cite>Foul Play</cite>, as first
acted, was later revived under different titles—<cite>The Scuttled Ship</cite>

<p class='c020'>The bibliography of Reade's plays is obscure and confusing.
I have listed in the foregoing pages only those of
the printed issue of which I have found certain evidence.
He is known, however, to have written many more,
some at least of which were probably printed privately.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>Wherefore it seems desirable here to supply such particulars
as can be found of the writing and acting of
Reade's other plays. The facts are taken mainly from
Coleman's book, which contains as an appendix a good
list of titles and dates of production. Unfortunately the
book itself is so confusingly put together that text and
appendix are far from complementary and at times even
in conflict.</p>

    <div>G. J. WHYTE-MELVILLE</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>
<p class='c012'>Although as an authority on matters sporting Whyte-Melville
stands alone, it is yet impossible, with the best
will in the world and with all the respect due to his personal
chivalry and courage, to regard him in the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rôle</span> of
novelist as anything but absurd.</p>

<p class='c000'>His books, where they deal with the science and the
joys of hunting, have the vivid appeal that only delighted
conviction can give; but as fiction, as readings
of life adequately expressed in English prose, they are
negligible and often ludicrous.</p>

<p class='c000'>Whyte-Melville, the sportsman, is a figure of dignity
and inspiration; Whyte-Melville, the social novelist, is
Ouida in breeches. That the breeches are of perfect cut
may not disguise the conventional swagger of the legs
they cover. The ways trodden by this author in his
search for character and incident are the exclusive ways
of Victorian landlordism. Their pavements are thronged
with fair ladies and brave gentlemen, while in the roadway
crowd the lower orders—some mildly criminal, some
a little comic, but the majority joyous in their privilege
to serve the brilliant purpose of their betters. The
antics of these humble creatures are watched with kindly
patronage by those to whom wealth and pleasure are a
normal birthright. Conversing among themselves,
heartily but with elegance, the Guardsmen and squirelings
of the fashionable clubs find time to exchange
gracious greeting with their poorer neighbours, whose
uncouth speech strikes quaintly pleasant on their cultured
ears. An instruction is given; half a sovereign changes
hands; a cap is dutifully touched. God willed that of
His creatures some be rich and others poor; let the
former bear themselves honourably and remember (when
not otherwise engaged) the duties of their station; let
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>the latter be happy in the lot to which Providence has
called them.</p>

<p class='c000'>But genial condescension to his dependants is not the
only or even the main business of the Whyte-Melville
gentleman. His life has two absorbing interests—horses
and ladies. To a point these interests merge. With
identical <em>expertise</em> he takes the points of a fine girl and
of a blood mare. The former in her drawing-room, the
latter in her stable, await in gleaming beauty his appreciative
caress. At their point of ultimate usefulness,
however, femininity and horseflesh part company. The
latter is the hero's ally, the former his quarry in the
chase; and while his adventures on horseback are told
with the zest and knowledge of real authority, his exploits
in lady-killing have the tedious unreality of a tale
only half imagined and not a quarter lived.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is for the falseness of his emotional writing that
Whyte-Melville challenges comparison with Ouida.
And, the comparison made, one is bound to concede victory
to the latter. Both deal in the passions of the nobly
born; but while the woman has at least the courage of
bad taste, the man, fettered by good form, achieves no
taste at all. Whyte-Melville's novels, like <cite>Hamlet</cite>, are
full of quotations. He is the father of novelette; the
wellspring of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cliché</span>. His lovely ladies are not women
nor his gallants men: they are the dummies of suburban
melodrama, exquisitely gowned, faultlessly tailored,
mouthing the phrases of drawing-room passionates,
but, even as dummies, failing to achieve that semblance
of gilded sin that is their only purpose.</p>

<p class='c000'>Nevertheless, despite their ineptitude, the books of
Whyte-Melville compel a curious and obscure respect.
Respect for what it were hard to say, for his written word
is his own deadliest accuser. Sentences might be chosen
almost at random from the novels of social life that would
prove his possession of every fault possible to a novelist
and to a writer of prose. And yet, through the screen of
their fatuity, one has glimpses of the personality of the
author himself—a personality at which one may make
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>mock, but only with affection. This country gentleman
turned novelist was an upright, guileless creature, hard
riding, generous hearted, as unconscious of his innate
snobbery as of his natural modesty, conventional because
unaware of any world or school of thought beyond
the narrow limits of his own. His pictures of England
are as dull and as unreal as the pretty garden scenes in
water-colour produced by county ladies to this day; but
both the painter of these lifeless pictures and the comfortable
amateurs responsible for horrid views of moorland
and herbaceous border command a sort of wistful
admiration. There is something so clean and easy and
contented in the mentality from which these books and
drawings spring that, if only it were not so stupid, so
impenetrable to variety of idea, its passing might well
be looked on with regret. Whyte-Melville's qualities,
like those of the type he represents, are more obscure
than his defects. The class of country gentleman to
which he personally belonged is rapidly disappearing;
when it is gone we shall wonder a little perplexedly why
we miss it. It was so easy to ridicule, so pathetically a
target for mockery and persecution. In our greater
wisdom we have shot it to pieces, riddling its obtuse
selfishness, its bland complacency, with the bullets of
reforming zeal. But something fine will have perished
with it, something indefinable but leaving a sense of gap,
to remind us that destruction is never quite the discriminating
triumph that iconoclasts claim for it in
advance.</p>

<p class='c000'>This, then, is one contemporary view of Whyte-Melville's
novels, whose only demonstrable virtue is
their sportsmanship. One may quote from <cite>Market
Harborough</cite>, from <cite>Riding Recollections</cite>, even from the
social stories, passages of speed and exhilaration, passages
of unaffected wisdom and perception, descriptive
of the hunting that, next to honour, he loved best of all
that life could offer. In opposition may be printed page
after page of stilted rhetoric, mawkish humour, the
falsest of sentiment, the most wanton elaboration of noun
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>and adjective. But after all quotation is done and a
balance struck, there will still remain the elusive quality
that gave character to the class from which the author
came, an essence of breeding and tradition that no phrasing
can crystallize, that vanishes in the moment of its
expression. For this spiritual quality Whyte-Melville
is admirable; for his literary faults he is unreadable.
Such, in a nutshell, is the judgment of one reader who
cannot excuse a book stupidity and pretentiousness for
the sake of isolated passages of hunting lore, but seeks
to appreciate in the character of a social generation that
is fading fast, a distinction that to all seeming will fade
with it.</p>

<p class='c000'>There are, however, readers of other kinds, and for
their sake and because among our grandmothers and
our aunts the stories of Whyte-Melville were avidly
admired, a summary classification of his books shall be
attempted.</p>

<p class='c000'>He began as a writer of autobiographies, of the part-fashionable,
part-sporting, part-knockabout kind, the
tradition of which came down from the eighteenth century,
through Frederick Marryat, to a dozen writers of
the hard-drinking, riotous forties. <cite>Digby Grand</cite> (1853)
and <cite>Tilbury Nogo</cite> (1854) are essentially novels of this
type, while in <cite>Kate Coventry</cite> (1856) the author merely
adapts the recipe to the needs of a girl heroine. <cite>The
Interpreter</cite> (1858) strikes a note of its own, for the scenes
in the Crimea and in Turkey were drawn from the
writer's experience and give a convincing picture of the
period and its happenings. Apart from them, however,
the book is an ordinary first-person record of the social
wanderings of a young Englishman of family.</p>

<p class='c000'>Between the second and the third of the books above
mentioned had appeared <cite>General Bounce</cite> (1855), a
transitional novel, not wholly apart from those that preceded
it, but halfway to a place among the stories of
contemporary love-making and sport, of which the
author was to produce a lengthy list. These novels of
English society contain much of the most repellent of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>Whyte-Melville's work, although many have refreshing
interludes of hunting and scenes on the racecourse or in
the stable that will endear them to specialists in the
genre, if they cannot reconcile others to the artificial
tedium of the love stories and the clumsy contriving of
the plots. Here are the titles of the social novels:</p>

<p class='c000'>Next in numerical importance are the costume novels,
beloved of an earlier generation, but to the critical
modern reader the poorest of poor stuff, so compact of
Wardour Street, of hollow sentiment, and of forced,
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">démodé</span> attitude as to be intolerable.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>There remain two books of purely sporting significance,
and <cite>Katerfelto</cite>.</p>

<p class='c000'><cite>Market Harborough</cite> (1861), the pride of the Pytchley,
is hardly a novel. It is a string of hunting and horse-dealing
episodes into which Whyte-Melville threw all
that he had of science and of enthusiasm. <cite>Riding
Recollections</cite> (1878) are what their name implies. It is
not for any but the expert to criticize these books, which
are held in some quarters to be essential textbooks to a
hunting education. <cite>Katerfelto</cite> (1875) will also escape
comment here, but for a different reason. Among my
childhood memories this Exmoor tale glows adored,
uncriticized. How will it read to-day? To put it to
the test frightens me. I dare not open it.</p>

<p class='c016'>THE BONES AT ROTHWELL: A Lecture delivered
by the late Captain <span class='sc'>Whyte Melville</span>, being an
account of the remarkable bone cavern beneath
Rothwell Church. Price 1d. Rothwell, printed
by Ed. Chamberlain, 3 Market Place. (Quotation
from Gray's <cite>Elegy</cite> heads title-page and wrapper.)
1 vol. Cr. 8vo. 16 pp. White paper wrappers,
printed in black. Outside back wrapper occupied
by printer's advertisements.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Note</span>—This is the text of a lecture delivered by Whyte-Melville
on January 3, 1862, to the Moulton Religious and Useful Knowledge
Society, and printed in the “Northampton Mercury” for
January 11 of the same year. When first the pamphlet above
described was issued I cannot be certain, but R. B. Wallis, in a
booklet published in 1888, and entitled <cite>All About the Rothwell
Bones</cite>, speaks of the lecture as obtainable in pamphlet form from
Chamberlan of Rothwell. Certainly, therefore, the publication
predates 1888, and I have ventured above on the date of the year
following Whyte-Melville's death because it seems possible that the
lecture was first issued in pamphlet form to combine the interest
in the Rothwell Bones with that likely to be created in Whyte-Melville
by his decease. The clumsiness with which Whyte-Melville
is spoken of as “the late,” but at the same time given the
rank of “Captain” instead of that of “Major,” implies a hasty
reprint from the file of the “Northampton Mercury,” by someone
aware of his death but careless of the military rank to which he
finally attained.</p>

<p class='c009'>The colour of the paper wrapper varies with different issues.
In addition to a white copy, as above described, I have seen one
in a pale yellow cover.</p>

    <div>HERMAN MELVILLE</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c012'>At intervals during the last forty years, Herman Melville
has been discovered by intellectuals, belauded, a
little read, and once more forgotten. It is typical of the
man and of his perverse withdrawal from the lettered
world, that even before his death he was the subject of
spasmodic <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">battues</span> by appreciative readers, who sought
to startle into activity their idol's reputation by methods
suited to the enlivenment of an author long dead and
hidden by the undergrowth of time.</p>

<p class='c000'>The latest and the most thorough stimulation to which
the repute of Melville has been subjected is now at full
stretch. Whatever its critical shortcomings, this concerted
attempt to write a new name on the roll of nineteenth-century
genius bids fair to achieve one important
triumph—the immortalization of <cite>Moby Dick</cite> and, consequentially,
of the man who wrote it.</p>

<p class='c000'>A very minor result of the same Melville boom is his
inclusion in this book. Save in the matter of date, he
has little in common with the other writers here treated.
They are of Victorianism Victorian; he, if he belongs to
any period or to any genealogy, is of the ageless, race-less
family of the lonely giants. That his fellows between
these covers are all lesser novelists than he, I am unprepared
to admit. Trollope excels him in humour, wisdom
and depth of understanding; he must rank, as master of
technique, below all save Whyte-Melville and perhaps
Disraeli. But he has a quality of grandeur, a majesty
of isolation that they lack, and his very inchoate bitterness
of spirit transcends by its datelessness their well-rounded
friendliness and their complacent wit.</p>

<p class='c000'>If that were not enough, he differs from them also in
the very texture and subject of his work. His mysticism,
for all its yearning and its gloom, is of a spiritual quality
far rarer than that of their materialism, for all its vivacity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>and its aspiration. Between him and Reade is a certain
soul resemblance, but the advantage in this is Melville's.
He directly influenced the Englishman,<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c014'><sup>[4]</sup></a> and beside his
remote immensity Reade, even at his most massive and
his most contentious, seems but a dwarf, roaring disgruntlement
against the walls of Grub Street.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f4'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r4'>4</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>There is in existence the copy of <cite>Moby Dick</cite> in which Reade
made extensive notes and excisions, maybe with the idea of issuing
an abbreviated version. Readers of <cite>Love Me Little, Love Me Long</cite>
will immediately detect the influence of Melville's great book on the
whaling narrative related by Frank Dodd to Mr. Fountain and to
his lovely niece.</p>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Melville's books are the strange mirror of a strange
life. The young writer, famous at thirty, who yet lives
out a diminuendo of appreciation to an old age of disappointed
poverty, is no unfamiliar figure. One thinks
immediately of William Harrison Ainsworth, from the
foppish eminence of his early twenties to the last sad
years in a Tonbridge villa, when he laboured at the
regular production of three-volume fiction—one novel a
year at seventy-five pounds the time—alone amid the
memories of vanished splendour. But the man who as
a youth wins reputation in letters and passes, of deliberate
purpose, maturity and age in other, non-literary, pursuits
is a scarcer type, of which Melville is an unusual
example.</p>

<p class='c000'>Born in 1819, he published <cite>Typee</cite> at the age of
twenty-seven, <cite>Moby Dick</cite> five years later, and <cite>The Piazza
Tales</cite> in 1856. From then until his death, in 1891, he
wrote little, and, to the even greater detriment of his
fame, withdrew entirely from the society of writers,
hiding his name and his very existence behind the screen
of an obstinate reserve.</p>

<p class='c000'>I have no intention here either of summarizing the life
or of passing judgment on the works of Herman Melville.
The former is related in detail by Professor Raymond
Weaver, whose large biography is of so recent date
that any shorter presentment of the facts must merely be
a précis of the information therein contained. The
respective merits of the outstanding books are already
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>(and will remain for long enough) the sport of literary
publicists, to whose views and counter-views I refer the
curious. One feature, nevertheless, of contemporary
opinion challenges to protest my amateur temerity. Apart
from <cite>Moby Dick</cite>, the neo-Melvillian has little beyond
patronizing approval for the books of his hero; <cite>Typee</cite>
(1846) and <cite>Omoo</cite> (1847) are interesting records of travel,
remarkable mainly for the early date of their appearance
and as forerunners of the South Sea School in letters and
in painting. <cite>Mardi</cite> (1849), <cite>Redburn</cite> (1849), and <cite>White
Jacket</cite> (1850) claim respect as autobiography and for passages
that reveal their author's genius struggling toward
a more complete expression. These are the rising steps
to the crowning summit of Melville's work. There,
unique and peerless, stands <cite>Moby Dick</cite>; beyond it the
terraces fall away again, and even more steeply than they
rose.</p>

<p class='c000'>Is this opinion a just one? I am a little uncertain.
With no desire to denigrate <cite>Moby Dick</cite> or to deny it the
first place in <em>importance</em> among Melville's books, I would
venture that his genius is more perfectly and skilfully
revealed in a volume of stories belonging to the so-called
decadence. <cite>The Piazza Tales</cite> are liable to be dismissed
by the critic of to-day with kindly condescension as “the
best of the later work,” a judgment as misleading as it
is easily explained. In some degree the worship of <cite>Moby
Dick</cite> and the comparative neglect of the other work are
inevitable corollaries to the Melville boom at its present
stage. During the first period of any new æsthetic
wonder, the peculiar transcends the normal in the
imagination of disciples. Let the case of Melville be
paralleled with that of Tintoretto's pupil, Greco. When
first set in the revival of interest in this painter's work,
he was most admired when most bizarre. He won favour
for the contrast he presented to his immediate forerunners
and his contemporaries. The name of Greco stood for
certain mannerisms in colour and composition, and, the
more a Greco picture revealed those mannerisms, the
better a Greco it was judged to be. Already, from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>hand of time, this formula of appreciation is suffering
adjustment, but Melville is to-day precisely at the point
where yesterday Greco stood. Like the master of Toledo,
he has peculiar and noticeable tricks of matter and of
style. Because <cite>Moby Dick</cite> is of these tricks more
redolent than the author's other books, it tickles the
palate of contemporary enthusiasm more thoroughly
than do they.</p>

<p class='c000'>Such preference is by its very nature tenacious.
<cite>Moby Dick</cite>, for all that it is unmistakably Melville, is far
from flawless. What if Melville recognized its weaknesses?
What if he deplored those very characteristics
that are to-day lauded as his priceless individuality and
chief claim to fame? With all its vastness and its wonder,
the epic story of Ahab and the great white whale displays
the faults of its author as strikingly as it reveals his
talents. In years to come, when the glamour of oddity
has paled a little, it will be admitted that the book labours
under a sad weight of intolerable prolixity. Nor is this
prolixity implicit in the greatness of Melville's writing.
This is proved by the two chief stories in <cite>The Piazza
Tales</cite>. <cite>Benito Cereno</cite> and <cite>The Encatadas</cite> hold in the
small compass of their beauty the essence of their author's
supreme artistry. They are profound and lovely and
tenderly robust, but they are never tedious and never
wilful. Surely it were generous to admit that Melville
sought to improve on <cite>Moby Dick</cite> and that, in the matter
of technical control, he succeeded? These two stories
cannot as literary achievement compare with their vast
and teeming predecessor. That is natural. But they
may not be ignored as the last glimmer of a dying lamp.
They mark the highest technical level of their author's
work, and, had not within a year or two of their appearance
the darkness of self-distrust descended on him,
might well have proved a revelation of something yet to
come from the brain of Herman Melville, something
destined—but for the treacherous inhibition of human
frailty—to excel in power everything to which that brain
had previously given birth.</p>

The English edition predates the American one. 750 copies were

<p class='c009'>(ii) I have seen a copy of this edition bearing on the case the
name of T. C. Newby as publisher, but with the Bentley title-page.
This was probably a “remainder” copy, for Newby frequently
bought sheets of books that had not sold when originally published,
and issued them at a cheaper price wholly or partially over his
imprint.</p>

The numbering of pages is very erratic. Pp. (1)-(6)

p. (9) bears dedication; p. (10) is blank;

pp. (391)-(394) are unpaged and occupied by advertisements
of other works by Melville; pp. (395)-(406)
form a publishers' list, dated October, 1849,
and paged (1) to 14; pp. (407) and (408) are occupied
by publishers' advertisements, undated, but paged
(1) and 2; pp. (409)-(412) are blank; pp. (413) and

printed half-title. Purple-brown cloth, gilt, blocked
in blind. Yellow end-papers.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Note</span>—Copies of the first edition are found with fewer advertisement
pages at the end. These may well, in view of the irregular
nature of American bookmaking at that period, be contemporary
in issue with those more extensively furnished, but the collector
will naturally prefer a copy as complete as possible.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Notes</span>—(i) This book was published in May or June, 1856.</p>

<p class='c009'>(ii) It is doubtful whether copies of this book were ever actually
issued in England, despite the fact that Sampson Low and Co.
advertised the book at 9s. in June, 1856. At the most, copies may
exist with an English cancel title, but even this is improbable in
view of the joint imprint on the New York edition. It will be
noted that when previously Low imported Melville sheets (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">cf.</span></i>
<cite>Pierre</cite>, 1852) they inserted their own title-page and bound the book
differently for English issue, but in that case their name was not
printed on the American edition.</p>

<p class='c009'>(iii) Copies of the first American edition exist, with pale yellow
end-papers. These are thinner in quality than the grey-blue ones
above mentioned, and not chalk surfaced to the extent usual with
American tinted papers of the period. Indeed, they have more the
appearance of English than of American end-papers, but it is
difficult to believe that Sampson Low and Co. could have imported
sheets and cases from America, merely carrying out in this country
the process of binding.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to
date contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and
official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
